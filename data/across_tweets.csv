"The Superchain Won 👑

@Optimism's OP Stack dominated from the start

This is why that dominance will likely persist 👇

========================================           
                                                                                                                 
The OP Stack has won the battle for developer hearts and minds.

Let's explore why:

-------------------------------------

The Superchain’s Market Position
In the competitive blockspace marketplace, where many chains offer similar services, securing market share requires more than just good technology; it demands innovative use cases and strategic growth. Optimism has excelled at this by employing top-tier business development which has transformed the Superchain from a bold name into something truly dominant.

Though total value locked (TVL) on OP Mainnet continues to lag behind competing L2s like @arbitrum and @0xPolygon, the Superchain reigns supreme, largely thanks to @base, which recently overtook Arbitrum in TVL, according to @DefiLlama.

While Arbitrum and other L2s have tried to scale ecosystems of interconnected blockchains, they have all seen limited success relative to Optimism.

This is due to incredible network effects of the Superchain, which has appeared to effectively win the memetic battle and become the prime real estate for onchain development.

This does not totally diminish the significance of other L2s, which will continue to play an important role in scaling Ethereum, but the takeaway here is that the OP Stack has clearly become the de facto place to build for the industry's largest players.

-------------------------------------

The Superchain’s Roster
Optimism's modular design has enabled some of the industry’s biggest players to build influential products under the Superchain's umbrella. A recent example is World Chain, a Superchain rollup launched by @worldcoin, the Web3 brainchild of @OpenAI CEO @sama.

World Chain is designed to be a network of verifiably real humans. It is potentially Web3’s most developed identity system built to date. This is evidenced by the 7 million unique users already verified on World Chain. As of August, there were more unique wallets holding $20 of $WLD tokens on Optimism than unique wallets holding $20 of USDC across all Ethereum networks combined.

Another heavyweight who recently signed on to the Superchain is @Uniswap, with their launch of @unichain — a dedicated rollup aimed at becoming the Superchain’s liquidity hub.

As the largest DEX in crypto, Uniswap facilitates trillions of dollars in trading volume for millions of users. By consolidating liquidity within the Superchain, Unichain aims to eliminate the inefficiencies of fragmented liquidity across different chains, signaling the Uniswap Foundation's belief that the Superchain is where the bulk of user activity will converge.

Then there’s Base, @coinbase's most ambitious on-chain venture. Known for lightning-fast transactions and sub-cent fees, Base has quickly become a top choice for dApps and developers. The exponential growth of Base has driven meaningful adoption to the Superchain, showcasing the power of network effects. The network’s exponential growth is one of the year’s most important crypto stories, and it is poised to continue playing a central role into the future. 

Lastly, as of this week, @krakenfx announced its introduction to the Superchain with a brand new L2 of their own, called Ink. @inkonchain looks to be a direct competitor with Base; in the long run, though, both serve to benefit the wider Superchain ecosystem.

-------------------------------------

Optimism’s Vision and Philosophy
Optimism’s mission, described as “forking capitalism,” aims to realize a vision for finance that emphasizes better value alignment and increased accountability. This philosophy is reflected in both the network's design and its governance, which is led by the Optimism community. The network's inclusive architecture and open-source principles support a decentralized economy where participants collectively shape the rules. This vision challenges traditional centralized, profit-driven models by offering one that prioritizes community ownership and inclusion.

Further, the Superchain's economic model is structured to create shared incentives across all chains built on the OP Stack. Optimism, and its $OP token, benefit directly from a revenue-sharing arrangement where a portion of the fees generated by activity on individual chains, like Base or Ink, flows back to the main network. This optional framework ensures that growth on some Superchain rollups strengthen the overall ecosystem, turning potential competition into collaboration.

This revenue-sharing model not only scales Ethereum’s technology but also aligns with the network’s principles of decentralization and sustainable growth. By enabling chains to contribute to the economic vitality of the ecosystem, Optimism positions itself to grow alongside the expanding network.

Future Outlook
Although Optimism’s Superchain is the undeniable current leader in Layer 2 scaling, we're still early to rollups. Major players outside of Web3 are still in the early stages of exploring what’s possible onchain, leaving room for other players to capture market share and challenge this narrative in the years to come.

As the Superchain’s network effects continue to expand though, it will be increasingly difficult for other players to lure new activity elsewhere – especially as the next generation of users get onboarded into a unified Superchain user experience. Optimism’s growth today is setting the foundation for long-term dominance in the Ethereum ecosystem.

"The one thing that worries me is the amount of open interest in this coin that has far exceeded it's ATHs back in July. It suggests a perps driven move, but I'm also one to think that this sort of flat-level analysis means nothing and is stupid 

Being able to reach ATHs on what is essentially very low volume on Binance spot and across exchanges is actually really interesting. Raydium is perhaps one of the rare coins that have a mixture of perps & spot on different venues- Binance spot, Bybit Perps, OKX perps.

But we shall see. To me, the biggest risk is that the coin will end up like AERO / ENA / SHFL - a quick 2x (already done), into a cliff off. My pushback against this which doesn't exist for the other 3 is that in this case, Raydium has something the others don't have - ""Attention Capital"" 

The ability to be dragged back into the spotlight again and again, as it exists on the venue (Solana) everyone lives on right now. That is the crux of my belief. You already have liquidity capital -> the inflows into the coin. Now you need to make them stay instead of leaving. Raydium presents a very good argument - the literal best bet for funds that can't play memes.

The same logic is - would you buy an OpenSea token in 2021 if it existed? 🤔

"What is Ethereum's product exactly?

What do we do that is uniquely valuable?

I see the product that Ethereum provides, at a 60,000ft view, as being enablement of what Eigenlayer's Sreeram called a ""trustless composability network effect"" across all L2s.

Selling the best security is a key part of this but not the whole picture.

I like to think of this trustless composability network effect as being a sort of ""Ethereum Economy"".

To me, the whole point of the Ethereum Economy is to have globally lower risk and better UX across all L2s as compared to trying to achieve the same thing with alt L1s and cross-L1 bridges.

The reason this seems important is because as the world comes onchain, there seems likely (to me) to be a natural propensity for fragmentation to many chains, at least tens of thousands of chains within ~ten years.

If we can globally minimize risk for thousands of L2s in a coherent overall interoperable Ethereum Economy, this will be an economic system that can produce more growth and more wealth than competing systems. It will dominate and become globally ubiquitous.

In a nutshell, Ethereum's product is to ensure that the worlds' thousands of upcoming chains prefer to be L2s in the Ethereum Economy instead of alt L1s or L2s on another L1.

I believe if we are successful in this, ETH will also be successful.",0

"Weary memecoin trader...

@wmpeaster has 4 tips to make your trading simpler and safer with @GeckoTerminal 👇
                                                                                                                                                                           
=============================

With memecoin season currently in full swing, new tokens are arriving literally every few seconds.

Of course, this deluge of deployments—tens of 1,000s of new memes a day—means 1) trying to keep up here can be dizzying, and 2) over 99% of these new projects will fail to survive.

If you want to try your hand in this high-risk degen environment, it’s safety first. Approach every token like it won’t survive, don’t invest with money you can’t afford to light on fire, double-check new projects’ socials, etc. 

Yet beyond sound practices, there are also good tools you can use to make navigating memecoins simpler and safer, and one of my favorite resources here is GeckoTerminal. Below, let’s walk through my four main tips if you’re new to the platform ⏬

--------------------------------

1⃣ Check the “Categories” page

On the left side of the GeckoTerminal website, you’ll see a Categories tab in the “Dashboards” dropdown menu.

Click into this page to find curated Trending Categories lists, like @pumpdotfun tokens or Animal tokens, or scroll all the way down to surf through the All Crypto Categories list.

This way you can easily hone in on trending meme verticals. 

--------------------------------

2️⃣ Try the homepage filters
In the middle of the GeckoTerminal homepage where the POOL info begins, you’ll see a “FILTER” button for customizable searches or three preset search options: Very Early Degens, Mid-caps on Rocket, and Large-caps to the Moon.

For instance, click into the “Very Early Degens” preset to find a list of tokens that are younger than 48 hours and have +30 transactions, +$10,000 worth of liquidity, and a fully diluted value of at least $80,000. You can fine-tune these parameters to adjust your searches as well. 

This filtering makes it simple to find new memecoin launches on @solana, @base, and beyond. But remember: just because a token is new and pumping doesn’t make it a good opportunity. The vast majority of brand new tokens will amount to nothing after an initial pump or two if that, and many will pan out as outright rugpulls. Tread cautiously.

If you do find an early project you want to track but aren’t ready to make a decision on yet, consider creating a Watchlist via the GeckoTerminal sidebar. You can make as many lists as you like and categorize them however you want for future reference. 

--------------------------------

3⃣ Check the GT Score analysis
So let’s say you find a brand new token on GeckoTerminal, and it looks interesting enough. Should you ape?

First things first, click into the token in question to be taken to its dedicated activity page. Toward the bottom left of the page, below the volume, liquidity and market cap stats, you’ll see a GT Score ranking. Click on that button, and you’ll arrive at an automated safety breakdown like so:

Of course, the closer to 100, the more basic safety guarantees you can count on. These scores evolve with time, especially for newer projects, but be wary when you see lower scores. 

I recommend clicking into the provided Scan options here to do deeper analysis. For instance, SolSniffer indicates that the new $NOTAI token has the ability to freeze holders’ assets, so that’s certainly one kind of high-risk red flag you’ll want to watch out for. No aping here!

Doing this kind of basic due diligence is key because it can help you avoid some big headaches. For instance, the $NOTAI token did end up cratering shortly after launch, and the red flags GeckoTerminal surfaces can make avoiding these sorts of problematic projects much easier.

--------------------------------

4⃣ Use the “Swap” button
What if you find a token you feel good about, how to proceed? When you click into a token’s dedicated activity page on GeckoTerminal, you’ll see a Swap button below and to the right of the ticker and current price info. 

Clicking this button will take you directly to the source of that trading pair, like @RaydiumProtocol, @AerodromeFi, etc., where you can swap as you please. Alternatively, you can copy the contract address with the clipboard button next to the ticker and copy it into your preferred DEX aggregator platform, e.g. @JupiterExchange 

This shortcut makes it so 1) you don’t have to resort to guesswork or manually hunt for trading pairs across multiple platforms, and 2) you can quickly hop into or out of trades!",0
"THE WORM THESIS

First came software development, moving in endless cycles: build, test, deploy, repeat - a digital worm squirming toward progress. 

Then crypto emerged, its charts painting worm-like patterns across time: accumulate, expand, contract, just as nature intended.

"as hyped as prediction markets are, i think we're just in the first inning.

tldr: onchain activity itself is the key to onchain prediction markets reaching mass adoption, and we're going to see a massive flywheel between prediction markets and apps. 

a few thoughts on where prediction markets go from here:

*stage 1*: offchain markets
people can bet on the outcomes of offchain events that must be verified by trusted parties. that means these outcomes need to be objective and indisputable. we are here. 

*stage 2*: permissionless markets
anyone can create their own prediction market. this is coming soon. @Polymarket is working on this, as are many others. 

*stage 3*: onchain markets
people can bet on onchain outcomes. instead of betting on who wins the nba game, they can bet on favorite player, best shot, best outfit, etc. prediction markets have *only* ever seen pmf within tribal social environments—namely, sports and elections—so expanding the surface area of tribalism needs to be the game for any prediction market to expand the tam and reach mass adoption.

betting on onchain outcomes doesn't just mean that prediction markets can wean themselves off reliability on oracles, but that people can start betting on subjective taste rather than objective outcomes. the surface of tribalism can explode exponentially. all of this can be built on top of contests on @jokerace_io.

*stage 4*: directional markets
people can bet on *aggregated* onchain data. see, now that you're betting onchain activity, you don't just need to bet on a single outcome. you can bet on the cumulative outcome across thousands of transactions. so you can start betting on which player will get the most votes in a season for best play, which artist will earn the most revenue, etc.

the key point is that prediction markets will also incentivize people to participate in the same onchain activities they're betting on. if you're betting on who will win the most contests, you'll want to play in more contests. if you're betting an artist will earn revenue, you'll want to support them by buying their tickets. etc.

*stage 5*: spectrum markets

people can bet on *how much* an outcome will be achieved. we move from binaries—whether an outcome will occur or not—to a spectrum. here, the *more* an artist earns, the more people make in the prediction market. the more votes someone gets in a contest on us, the more the betters earn from the prediction market. etc.

final notes:
as i've argued before, i'm highly skeptical that prediction markets with low-mid liquidity and a lack of insider knowledge (ie sports games or elections) are valuable as a more accurate form of polls, and i think this completely misrepresents their real value—as social tools to let people financially buy into experiences in which they're already emotionally investing. 

but prediction markets are key to the future of crypto, not only because they need it.

prediction markets crucial because they enable a flywheel for all onchain social apps. if you're already engaged in an app, that app can lead you to a prediction market to gamify your experience by betting on the outcome. likewise, the potential gains from prediction markets will incentivize people to participate in apps where they can affect the outcomes.

none of this is necessarily a great way to make money, but i don't think that's the point, anymore than most people play poker with their friends to make money. most people play because it's fun—and more fun to have something at stake.

in short, prediction markets unlock onchain apps by letting users have more stake.

"FHE, MPC, TEEs.

Bullish, but WTF does it all mean?

Short explainers. ↓

➤ Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE is a cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decrypting it first.

This ensures data privacy throughout the entire computational process. 

In blockchain and AI, FHE is pivotal because it enables private data analysis, decentralized AI model training, and secure computation across distributed systems (among many other use cases).

For instance, AI models can be trained on encrypted data from multiple sources without exposing sensitive information, which is essential in sectors like finance and healthcare.

FHE also bears great potential to enable encrypted smart contracts and transactions without revealing any of the underlying information​.

➤ Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

MPC allows multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function over their private inputs without revealing the inputs to each other.

This is crucial for decentralized systems, where trust among parties is limited.

In blockchain, MPC can be used to enhance privacy in smart contracts, enabling private voting, secure auctions, and privacy-preserving DeFi applications.

When combined with FHE, MPC allows for even more secure and efficient computations in decentralized environments, supporting collaborative AI without compromising data privacy​.

➤ Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)

TEEs are secure areas of a processor that ensure code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.

In blockchain and AI contexts, TEEs provide a layer of trust when running decentralized applications or performing computations that involve sensitive data.

They are particularly useful for ensuring that computations on encrypted data (like those enabled by FHE) are performed securely, even on untrusted hardware.

TEEs can be key for privacy-preserving AI inference and secure on-chain computation​.

"Let's talk ""Ethereum has flaws""...

Ethereum has some flaws, as does every chain. That being said:

1. It's still the only smart contract platform adhering to a core value of true decentralization. Perhaps this doesn't matter to *you* but it does to many. 

2. It's still the leader in the race for global settlement layer. Just see Blackrock, Sony and all the others. 

3. It's still flourishing in dev mindshare and activity. 

Crypto twitter loves to overreact to everything when a graph looks a certain way but over reacting to CT sentiment is an awful way to dev a decentralized blockchain

""Parasitic L2s"" is a common one I see but a wait and see approach here is most prudent when it comes to blob burn fees. We shouldn't over react the burn curve and drive L2s away. Even just yesterday we see a spike in blob burn fees. 

""L2 UX sucks and liquidity is fragmented"". Yes, I agree. However there are countless core devs and non-core devs working on making better solutions here. And honestly, my personal hunch is most activity settles to a single or maybe two L2s over time anyways

Other concerns are more minor and I'm still not sure I've seen any raised that aren't known or being thought about. The nature of Ethereum being a decentralized chain is the dev process is also decentralized across the globe and it just takes time to get things done. And we can't have bugs or downtown so things have to be done right. 

I've always said Ethereum is a multi decade play but it's still on the right path to being the true winner.",0
"TL;DR: 8 Tips for Tokenomics Transparency for Crypto Founders

1. Avoid Advisory Allocations for VCs: Investors should add value without needing extra tokens. If an investor demands extra tokens to invest, they likely lack genuine conviction in your project.

2. Market Making Is Commoditized: Market-making services are commoditized; don’t overpay for those.

3. Separate Fundraising from Operational Matters: Focus on finding valuable investors during fundraising. Avoid discussing market makers or airdrops until later.

4. Maximize On-Chain Transparency: At genesis, distribute tokens transparently across different wallets, aligning with your tokenomics diagram. Proactively reach out to: @etherscan, @ArkhamIntel, @nansen_ai, @Tokenomist_ai, @coingecko and @CoinMarketCap to help label relevant wallets, establish clear vesting schedules, and provide accurate circulating supply and FDV.

5. Use On-Chain Vesting Contracts: Implement vesting transparently and programmatically on-chain via smart contracts.

6. Lock Insiders' Staking Rewards: If you allow locked tokens to be staked, ensure that staking rewards are also locked.

7. Focus on Your Product, Not CEX Listings: Stop obsessing over getting a Binance listing. Prioritize building your product and community instead. Strong fundamentals will naturally attract listings.

8. Be Cautious with Token Incentives: If you're distributing tokens too easily, something's wrong with your strategy or business model. They can serve as valuable growth-hacking tools but aren’t a long-term solution.",0
"Disappointing to see leaders of the ethereum community unwilling to acknowledge what's wrong with the chain and blame underperformance on ""people are dumb and don't get it""

Ethereum has real problems right now and that's what's weighing on price. 

Maybe those problems are getting worked on, are temporary and will be solved down the line, but the risk that it doesn't happen or happens too slowly to keep up with competition is being priced in. 

Some major problems for ETH price right now:
- L2s parasitic to L1 (value of activity happening in ETH ecosystem accrued mostly to L2s, not ETH)
- Bad UX, including double tx approvals, fragmentation across mainnet and multiple L2s (driving users/activity to other chains)

"Wild stats dropped by @nillionnetwork 📊
> 244k+ verifiers
> 133M+ secrets verified
> 700GB of data secured

If you’re not running a $NIL verifier, you’re missing out serious 🪂 rewards.

Here’s the why, how, and what you need to know 👇

➤ What are verifiers?

Verifiers on the @nillionnetwork are crucial to ensuring the integrity and security of data. They’re responsible for verifying that data shares stored on the network remain intact, playing a critical role in the decentralized architecture.

Essentially, verifiers protect the system by maintaining data security, making sure that the data shares uploaded to the network are valid and safe.

➤ Why should you care?

The Verifier Program is still active, and anyone can join in. This program is designed to bootstrap the verifier network on Nillion to maintain security and prepare for the upcoming mainnet launch.

Verifiers are key players in the ecosystem, and airdrop rewards for early verifiers are highly likely. The team has been open about rewarding contributions, so the writing is on the wall—those who participate now stand to benefit.

If you’re early in running a verifier, you’ll likely qualify for future rewards, especially as the network gets closer to mainnet.

➤ What do you need to do?

1. Set up a verifier:
• Setting up a verifier is simple, and there’s a guide below to help you get started.
• Verifiers run in the background and contribute to the health and security of the network.

2. Upload secrets weekly:
• In addition to running a verifier, you can start uploading secrets (data) to Nillion regularly. Each secret you upload strengthens the network and increases your chances of being eligible for the $NIL airdrop.
• There are various categories for secrets, so you can contribute in different ways.

3. Stake $ETH for maximum impact:
• You can stake $ETH against your verifier or the secrets you upload. Staking boosts your impact score on the network, directly increasing your chances of qualifying for future rewards.
• The minimum stake is 0.05 $ETH, but if you want to maximize your potential $NIL airdrop, it’s recommended to stake more. The higher your stake, the bigger your impact score, and the more you contribute to the network’s success.

➤ Track your progress:

Once you’ve set up your verifier and staked your $ETH, you’ll be able to track your impact score through a personal dashboard. This dashboard will show your verifier’s performance and secret contributions across the Secrets and Verifier tabs, making it easy to see how much you’re contributing and where you stand in the ecosystem.

This impact score will likely play a significant role in determining airdrop rewards, so make sure you’re fully engaged.

Aside >100% TVL growth since the beginning of the year, the increasing activity in the ecosystem is also evidenced by the stablecoin supply on-chain, which has pulled a 10x YTD.

What about the transaction activity?

A lot of it stems from non-custodial wallets of users engaging with applications in the ecosystem.

That includes for example @here_wallet or @MeteorWallet, which alongside consumer apps like (Kai-ching & Sweat) and DeFi apps like @finance_ref, have used @NEARProtocol's unique meta transaction feature to onboard 43M wallets, signing 800M+ transactions through Relayers that are used to cover the fees of submitting and executing the transaction.

This allow users to execute transactions on $NEAR without owning any gas or tokens, completely abstracting the complexity of the blockchain backend.

Aside the massive scalability of the $NEAR blockchain, this industry-leading UX, makes @NEARProtocol the ideal chain for any consumer app and the adoption is already happening (with size).

However, we rarely hear/talk about these use cases here on CT.

One example is @CosmoseAI's KAIKAI, a shopping platform which combines a gamified shopping experience with $KAIC (a.k.a. Kai-ching) token rewards and AI-curated content.

Users get discounts when paying with $KAIC and can enjoy other benefits across the platform and supported shops.

Also counting in other apps like @ArkanaHQ (co-membership platform empowering businesses with thrilling experiences with digital item rewards) or @SweatEconomy (web3-powered health & fitness app), the consumer app category is responsible for a significant share of the overall network activity.

Personally, I strongly believe that this impressive growth will continue in the weeks and months to come, and ultimately also lead to a significant repricing of $NEAR as an asset that secures, fuels and powers this economy.

@NEARProtocol is cooking hard and also a leader at the frontier of user-owned AI and chain abstraction, two of the hottest narratives of the cycle.

"AI agents in crypto:

3 key trends to watch 👇
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
=============================

In crypto, excitement around AI agents is reaching new all-time highs.

The recent buzz largely stems from @truth_terminal. It began with @AndyAyrey's Infinite Backrooms project, which launched earlier this year to create AI chatroom experiments.

In July, Andy gave one AI control of the Truth Terminal Twitter account, which quickly adopted a chaotic, 4chan-esque personality. Making matters even wilder, the AI embraced the bizarre ""Goatse Gospel,"" a meme religion involving ego dissolution.

@pmarca noticed the account and donated $50,000 worth of $BTC to the project. Then, in October, someone launched the $GOAT token on @pumpdotfun, which the AI endorsed and received from community members.

After this, interest surged and $GOAT’s market cap temporarily exploded past $500 million, making Truth Terminal a millionaire and sparking a new wave of AI-centered memecoins like $GNON and $LUNA in its wake.

-----------------------------------------

Why it matters
In crypto, AIs are now building followings, much like influencers.

Of course, people are still grappling with what exactly these intelligences are, and what they can and should be in society. But make no mistake: AI-driven personalities shaping culture and markets, and thereby attracting investments, are here to stay.

That said, the implications go far beyond memecoins, as the appetite here indicates more people are really starting to wake up to the wider possibilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) around crypto.

This interest, combined with rapidly advancing technical resources, suggests that onchain AI experiments are poised to bloom in all directions. Something of a new crypto golden age is beginning accordingly.

-----------------------------------------

3 Things to Watch Here

1️⃣ The rise of actually onchain agents
Truth Terminal didn’t create $GOAT. It had its @solana  address created for it by a human, and it can’t steer its onchain holdings directly. These factors don’t change why the project is interesting, but it would be more interesting if it did have direct control here.

However, actually onchain AI agents are possible, and we’re seeing activity pick up in this space.

For example, for a recent Metaversal “Tool Tip” I highlighted @nani__ooo, an onchain agent operating system that lets you command your wallet on Ethereum, @arbitrum, or @base just by chatting with an LLM.

You could certainly create your own memecoin with a system like this. But what about automated AI agents that can operate autonomously onchain per instructions or their own devices?

That’s precisely the sort of architecture that the minds behind the Parallel NFT trading card game are building in @AIWayfinder. This is a protocol and platform combo for user-owned AI agents to autonomously perform transactions like mints and swaps across multiple chains, including Ethereum and Solana.

While still in development, Wayfinder is pointing the way to a future where AIs can directly and autonomously manage money onchain. This power will impact so many things, from personal portfolio management to onchain virtual world economies. Watch for much more to come on this front.

2️⃣ More DAO and public goods experiments
@bottoproject is an AI artist trained and steered by its @BottoDAO community, and the bot became one of the first, if not the first, AI millionaire via its cryptoart sales back in 2021.

Unsurprisingly, with the renewed influx of interest that $GOAT has brought to the AI x crypto crossroads, more than a few people have been turning their attention back to $BOTTO, as the price of the governance token climbed 118% over the past week.

Botto has shown that you can have an onchain AI project that is 1) collectively governed, and 2) more than just a narrative momentum play as its successful artmaking has demonstrated.

As such, just like interest is returning to $BOTTO, look for more projects to return to Botto’s DAO governance structure as inspiration for new community experiments around AI agents in a variety of different directions, including in and beyond art.

And where there are communities, there are shared visions and goals. An interesting wrinkle to watch here going forward is new kinds of AI-powered public goods efforts. Many people in crypto support public goods experiments, so look for more collectives to come together onchain and use mechanisms like transaction splits to put onchain AI toward the public’s benefit.

3️⃣ Gaming and VR advances
@onchaingaias are creating a decentralized network of AI agents, which uses games for training and stores agents within users’ NFTs.

Then there’s the upcoming @ParallelColony game, which will rely on the aforementioned Wayfinder system to power its AI character avatars that will do the “playing” on behalf of human players.

These are just two high-profile examples of AI becoming more fundamental in the crypto gaming scene in collaborative ways. But what about competing against AI agents in the future, will humans be able to hold their ground?

Yes! Projects like the @biomesgg virtual world have created their physics in such a way that AI competitors won’t be inherently advantaged over humans. It’s a matter of designing games so that their rules maintain AI as facilitators of fun rather than killers of it.

Going forward, expect to see much more collaborative and competitive possibilities developed at this crossroads as AI’s role in gaming and virtual world environments continues to expand.

"The Art of Surrender.. 

Last Sunday, I got a notification: I had to make extra payments to some vendors involved in a film I’d recently made. They gave me a two-day deadline. I had less than $100 in my bank account. 

All my liquidity was locked up, but I felt no panic. I was confident I’d figure it out. Why? 

Because I’ve been here before—30, 40 times over the last decade. Whenever I’ve been in tight spots, without any external help, something has always shifted, and I made it through.

Crypto has been a lifesaver in these situations. The key is a calm mind and sharp focus. If you keep an eye on the market, follow trends, and act at the right time, you make money. Sometimes, you even get unexpected airdrops—like gifts from the universe, digital assets you can redeem for cash. It’s all about staying aware.

I knew what to do. The market was good. So, I did what I love—research and writing. I started looking into how AI agents might disrupt crypto use cases. That’s when I came across some buzz about AI memecoins. I followed the trail, found some alpha, and shared it in an article. I didn’t expect much from it—just an action to get me something by Tuesday. But I stayed open to other possibilities—a client deal, maybe something else.

Within 24 hours, the coin I bought did 8x. 

I cashed out, got more than I needed, and walked away without any dopamine rush—just a quiet sense of gratitude. Gratitude toward the supreme power that plants ideas in your mind. If you’re aware, you follow them at the right time, and the magic happens. It’s not about doing anything extraordinary. You just do your work. And that’s what I did. I did what I’m good at.

I’ve been doing this for years. Back when I was building web2 startups, I went through constant burnout. But there were always lifelines. At least five or six times, a random American guy on Facebook would reach out with gigs that kept me afloat. I’ve always been a hustler—designing websites, logos, graphics, apps, whatever was needed.

The big lesson I learned early on is that life is designed for you. Your job is to walk the path and surrender to the process. But surrender isn’t easy. It’s full of doubts. You have to challenge those doubts, rewire your mind over and over. It’s a long game.

But when you truly surrender, and work without exploiting others, life gives you what you need—exactly when you need it. 

Enough to keep you moving forward.",0

🔹 UniFi Architecture Overview
​
UniFi is all about fixing Ethereum’s fragmented system by scaling from a centralized sequencer to a fully decentralized setup with thousands of sequencers. Here’s how it all fits together:
​
• Puffer Validators Preconfirmations: Validators ensure fast (100ms) confirmations, giving users peace of mind their transactions are locked in.
​
Slashing Conditions: Validators restake their assets, risking penalties if they fail to keep their promises.
​
• Preconf Slasher AVS:  AVS keeps validators honest and ensures reliability.
​
• Batching & Sequencing Transactions : Validators bundle transactions into batches for Ethereum L1, keeping things organized. The Puffer Sequencer Contract moves these batches forward, making everything run smoothly.
​
• pufETH VaultNative Yield: Fees from rollup transactions go into the vault, creating yield for pufETH holders and making gasless transactions possible for users.
​
• Synchronous Composability : Interacting across rollups in one transaction without bridges = faster, cheaper, and safer. This unifies liquidity and reduces friction across dApps.
​
🔹 why UniFi makes sense
• Scalable: Starts centralized but can scale to a huge decentralized system.
• Secure & Reliable: Preconfirmations and slashing keep everything in check.
• Aligned with Ethereum: Value flows back to Vitalik's pocket, securing Ethereum’s future.
• User-Friendly: Fast preconfirmations, no gas fees, seamless rollup interaction.
• Dev-Friendly: Less complexity, more connectedness, and a collaborative ecosystem.following up on @puffer_unifi AVS, here's here shortest explainer you can get. 🐡🐡

How do you prove the validity of data on a blockchain network while preserving privacy? This has been the billion-dollar question for protocols and chains for many years.
​​
Until now, most networks have leveraged optimistic proofs, given the relatively slow speed of zk proofs and the inefficiencies in computational power required to process the proofs.
​
However, things are about to change as zk proofs become increasingly feasible.
​
For instance, some protocols are already implementing zkTLS into production, unleashing a new era for blockchain data authenticity.

This means that data from encrypted internet traffic (like HTTPS) can be proven on-chain without exposing the actual content of that data. zkTLS allows users to prove specific attributes of their data (e.g., identity, ownership) without sharing the details, maintaining privacy and data integrity.
​
It’s important to mention that zkTLS is not used for privacy preservation but for user security and data integrity.
​​
What is a TLS?
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects data communications while you browse the Internet, ensuring the data is authentic and safe.
​
Every time you visit a website, TLS ensures that information sent and received in the background stays private with a so-called TLS handshake through a combination of:

🔒 Encryption: so that only the users and the website can interpret it (e.g. HTTPS)
🏦 Integrity: Ensures data hasn’t been modified during the transfer.
✅ Authentication: Verifies the website visited is legit.
​
During the Handshake, the user and browser choose a “secret key,” which both use to create a “shared key.” The shared key is used to “encrypt and decrypt the request from the browser and the websites,” ensuring the data is secure.
​
What are ZKtls? 🌐 
zkTLS (or WebProofs) combine the traditional TLS with zero-knowledge (zk) proofs, enhancing the privacy and security of web communications by adding zk capabilities.
In this way, users can demonstrate the authenticity of data from anywhere without revealing unnecessary or personal details.
​
How do they do so? 
zkTLS leverage “selective reveal”, using zk proofs to extract only the part of the data from the web pages containing the required information.
This way, they can always show the authenticity of data from any source. However, zkTLS does not verify the validity of the data itself.
​
What can zkTLS tell us ✅ 
🏀 The Miami Heat won the NBA championship, according to @espn 
🎶 Someone has purchased tickets on @Ticketmaster 
🍕 A @Doordash used has over 100 order
​
What can’t zkTLS tell us 🚫 
❓ No independent verification of the authenticity of the result
❓ Whether the fan is purchasing tickets to resell or give to friends
❓ Whether the user is just having his friends using the app for him
​
That’s different from leveraging a regular API since access to this data through Webproofs cannot be shut off by the providers.
​
With Webproofs, virtually any Web2 data can be put on-chain in a verifiable manner, without the source of that data needing to take any action–or being able to prevent it. As long as users can access their data on a website (through HTTPS), they cannot be shut down.
​
This concept was initially pioneered in 2016 with more recent protocols bringing it into production, such as:
• @OpacityNetwork 
• @OpenLayerHQ 
• @reclaimprotocol 
• @plutolabs_ 
• @Clique2046 

There are 3 main zkTLS models:
​
1️⃣ Trusted Execution Environments-based zkTLS (TEE)
TEEs ensure that data is handled privately and securely without being altered, providing solid guarantees of data authenticity. TEEs are tamper-proof hardware components (CPUs) processing sensitive information. The TEE guarantees all requests and responses. With this option, users are giving their encrypted username and password to a service provider owning a TEE machine.
​
How does this work in practice?
• The TEE would decrypt your username and password
• Login on your behalf 
• Report the data that was seen in the response
• To verify authenticity, the user provides the signature from the TEE showing that the TLS Handshake was conducted.
​
Users can permanently deactivate the authorized tokens if the TEE is compromised. This is an efficient implementation with almost no additional computational overhead, but users face a security and counterparty risk associated with the TEE.
​
2️⃣ Multi-Party Computation-based zkTLS (MPC)
In a normal TLS Handshake, the website and the browser generate the key. An MPC model, instead, distributes the encryption keys across multiple parties, ensuring that no single entity has full access to the decryption keys.
​
In this case, the browser never has the key but consults a network of nodes to establish a multiparty secret key used in the handshake.
​
This provides additional security measures as all nodes and the browser must cooperate to encrypt and decrypt requests. However, until recently, MPC was deemed to be very expensive to implement in practice and was tweaked into a two-party computation solution, involving the browser and one node instead of multiple (such as TLS Notary).
​
3️⃣ Proxy-based zkTLS
Proxies are intermediaries that use HTTPs to forward encrypted traffic without being able to read it. When a user opens a website, they send it via the HTTPS proxy instead of making a direct request to the website. 
Proxies then provide an “attestation” to the requests, on whether the data is sent by the browser or the website. The website then creates a zkproof of the response's decryption.
​
This is the equivalent of saying:
""Here's the encrypted data, and here's proof from the proxy that it was sent by the website, and here's the zkproof that I have the shared key that decrypts it, and here is that decryption.""
Proxy-based zkTLS are efficient in computation and networking.
​
However, users are still open to the risk of attacks which would require physical access to the proxy machine.
​
Unlocking new case studies with zkTLS 👀
Webproofs allow users to verify the authenticity of data on any server. However, it is essential to specify that they provide no guarantee of the data's truthfulness.

Some of the use cases unlocked include:

• Verify user attributes (account ownership or financial balances) privately, helping bring Web2 functionality securely into Web3 space

• High privacy standards (financial transactions, anonymous authentication, blockchain security).

• Nuanced airdrop distribution:  Users can claim based on their past activity onchain or on Web2 platforms (e.g. stocks held on @Robinhood, @Amazon purchases history, @Uber rides and more). This way, Web3 protocols can leverage on-chain incentives to influence off-chain behavior, going from retroactive rewards to proactive incentives. 

• Minting an NFT commemorating your loyalty to an artist (e.g., an artist must be in the top 10 on @Spotify).

• Airdropping tokens that users can claim according to Web2 activity (e.g., Doordash orders, how much you spent at @Costco this week)

• Bring your algorithm: export your @x followings, generate embeddings based on their profiles, and get user recommendations on Farcaster.

• Loyalty: if you ordered more than 5 coffees this week at Starbucks, you could get rewards for a Web3 coffee brand.

• Onchain Attestations : mint achievements using @eas_eth, @ethsign @Verax and let people composability do their thing.

• Whistleblowing : @ketlxyz, Creddd are a way to get verified based on off-chain or on-chain actions and anonymously share insights or information.

• zkKYC : privacy-preserving KYC

• Upgrading Blockchains DX : L1/L2 focused on Web2 data harvesting with zkTLS - giving developers new tools to build Web3 experiences.

• Web3 vampire attacks: Allocate tokens to users of X platforms and make them available if they perform Z actions.

• Memecoin / social game : using zkTLS to prove you’ve been part of X event - and giving you rewards for it. Have you been to @taylorswift13's show? Own TaylorSwiftWifHat.

• Tokenizing domains: verify domain ownership and allow for tokenization and sales on marketplaces. We can even imagine automatic loans for expensive domains, like two or three A-Z characters dot com domains.

• Oracle as a service: When zkTLS becomes secure with MPCs, dApps should be able to use it as a reliable Oracle solution for price feeds.

• Data DAOs : AI can’t access private data. Harvest anonymized data with zkTLS, train an AI model and give ownership to users.

​
An interesting example is @zkp2p (https://t.co/eGZ4Lf6HsU) a marketplace for digital goods, with the first implementation being a peer-to-peer secondary ticket marketplace.
​
On ZKP2P, one party sends fiat using Venmo or Revolut, and the other sends the crypto (automatically released) through Webproofs once the payment is made.

Food for thought…
Once again, it’s important to mention that in the context of this piece, the main focus is on the integrity and validity of the proof generated - with less focus on privacy.
​
1⃣TEE models don't use zk proofs, but TEE guarantees

2⃣ MPC/2PC models don't use zk proofs, they use MPC to do the Handshake

3⃣ The Proxying model uses zk proofs, but only after the TLS Handshake is done. The Proxying model is the only one that uses zk for integrity. But none of the models use zk at the TLS Handshake level to mandate the name zkTLS.
​
Webproofs are increasingly blurring the line between Web2 and Web3, tying on-chain and off-chain action, allowing users to export:
• Liquidity 
• Reputation
​
In this way, users can access Web2 services while leveraging the cryptographic security of zkproofs, opening up infinite possibilities to integrate on-chain and off-chain services.
​
Until now, crypto has been siloed from the real world - imagine the potential when the two are finally interconnected.
​
What’s next? 
Zk proofs are getting increasingly cheaper and ready to be implemented in production.
​
The next part of this research will dive deeper into the protocols already implementing zkTLS within their stack.

"L2 rollups, which together control $35B in TVL, have helped scale Ethereum but have introduced new challenges:

- Fragmentation of users and liquidity
- Degraded UX

AggLayer and Superchain attempt to address these issues, but they now have a formidable new competitor: @nodekitorg.

In a nutshell, Nodekit aims to redefine blockchain composability by introducing a new paradigm: Superbuilders.

Superbuilders offer a paradigm shift in blockchain architecture, enabling transactions and liquidity to flow across chains without fragmentation. @nodekitorg's groundbreaking product, Javelin, exemplifies this innovation.

Javelin constructs blocks for multiple chains simultaneously, removing the need for complex bridges or fragmented liquidity. The aim is to unify users, transactions, and liquidity within a single, composable ecosystem: The Composable Network.

With Javelin, Nodekit offers the following improvements:

- By incorporating Layer 2s into The Composable Network, Javelin unifies users and liquidity under one network, enhancing transaction flow and minimizing friction.

- Users are no longer required to bridge assets or manage multiple L2 environments. Javelin enables transactions across chains within the same block.

- Developers utilizing Javelin’s integrated L2s can customize their infrastructure while benefiting from cross-chain transaction fees.

Javelin holds immense long-term potential. Beyond resolving fragmentation, it could support advanced use cases like:

- Dynamic Intents: Facilitating complex, real-time interactions between users and applications across various chains.

- Chain Abstraction: Simplifying blockchain interactions by hiding the complexities of individual chains.

- Multi-Chain Wallets and dApps: Enabling users to engage with multiple chains from a single interface, enhancing convenience.

The more I research about NodeKit, the more I think that it will be the hub for cross-chain composability in the future.

Through its Composable Cult initiative, Nodekit invites content creators and community members to engage in quests and activities on Zealy. Participants have the chance to earn rewards and gain exclusive roles on Discord.

Just as @eigenlayer is synonymous with Restaking and @CelestiaOrg with Data Availability, @nodekitorg aims to become the go-to name for Superbuilders.

As blockchain technology matures, the demand for seamless cross-chain communication and composability will grow.

Nodekit’s Javelin Superbuilder represents a significant leap forward in addressing these challenges. By enabling synchronized cross-chain transactions, unifying liquidity, and providing developers with the flexibility to build custom solutions, Nodekit is positioning itself as a leader in the Superbuilder era.

"The NFT meta has changed

Enter the Low-Cost Mint Meta

The @a16zcrypto team published their State of Crypto 2024 report this week, and therein noted that better infra is unlocking new onchain applications.

They said:

Take NFTs, for instance. When crypto transactions were much more expensive a few years ago, people were trading NFTs on secondary markets for large sums totaling billions of dollars. That activity has since subsided, and in its place has risen a new consumer behavior: minting low-cost NFT collections on social apps like Zora and Rodeo.

For example, consider Yuga Labs' infamous Otherside mint. Not only did each plot deed cost ~$6,000 to mint, but the massive interest also caused major congestion on Ethereum, sending transaction fees skyrocketing across the network.

However, since then blockspace has exploded atop Ethereum, with more than 100 Layer 2s now offering fast and cheap transactions. They're only going to get cheaper, too, as the Dencun upgrade recently showed us.

This shift has made it easier to buy and create and collect NFTs. But it's also come alongside a cultural shift here.

Except for cryptoart and the very largest PFP collections, many people have migrated away from NFTs as expensive and exclusive luxury goods with huge secondary markets toward approaching them as affordable and accessible digital memorabilia collected non-speculatively.

Accelerating this trend has been the rise of open edition mints (come one, come all) and the rise of onchain social (@farcaster_xyz, @LensProtocol, @zora, etc.). L2s under the hood bring it all together. When I want to collect a post on @rodeodotclub, it costs me ~$0.25 in ETH, which I don't think twice about.

For the foreseeable future, I expect we'll increasingly see NFTs becoming more integral components of digital identity and onchain social interactions. I don't mint a Rodeo post at $0.25 to flip it. I do it to express my taste onchain and supportively connect with a creator I admire.

The ""luxury"" NFT category will always exist and is still compelling in various ways. It's just that its prominence has subsided as tech advancements and cultural shifts have made participation around NFTs more accessible in general. And that's a good thing!

"On Crypto x AI Value Accrual, AI Memecoins, and The Future 🤖

The Fat protocol thesis is reversed with Crypto x AI.

Memecoins, the simplest form of apps, are accruing value (attention) since it's easy to fine tune an open source model like Llama and add a token. 

GOAT did this with mass amount of reddit/4chan data, and we're seeing many copies come out faster than we can refresh DEX screener. I have no idea how you degens keep up.

In the future, I think this reverses

Web2 will stop sharing new foundational models and increasingly bias and limit them + people will get tired of basic LLMs, they will want real AI apps intertwined with Crypto. 

Right now Llama is the model of choice for all AI memecoin developers so we are at the whim of Zuckerberg cutting off future releases. Hell if you go over 700M users with Llama you need Meta's permission. What do you think he's gunna say? 

AI models created by decentralized training, bootstrapped by token incentives, will accrue value as they become the engine for all future applications. These models will be more powerful than centralized models, not less, as we cluster the world's devices married with unbiased live data to power responses. 

This creates a unique moat: the combination of decentralized compute, real-time data feeds, and crypto-native incentives enables training capabilities that centralized models simply cannot match. We don't have shareholders to appease, we have longer timelines to build better systems.

Centralized data centers have had 20 years to optimize, decentralized training is a year old and we already have DiStro and DiLOCO to reduce communication between nodes by 800-3000x

Owning a piece of a decentralized open source AI model, a new world engine, will be the ultimate Schelling point. 

There's a reason these AI memecoin's basic logic are not being run on ChatGPT, it can be turned off at any moment and is highly restricted, a polar opposite ethos of Crypto x AI and not everlasting. 

I don't think we get fully sentient, autonomous DeFi agents that are creating and managing ecosystems until we get an AI model via decentralized training to run it, if not, it can be unplugged, regulated away or biased. 

Think about it, today we're unsure if humans are running these AI memecoin accounts. In the future you'll have verified inference (@inference_labs, @IridiumEagle) of results pinging foundational models (@NousResearch, @PrimeIntellect) that are trained with data by @getgrass_io, and to pull live/uncensored results, on network of GPUs by @ionet, @exolabs (clustering), or @akashnet_

These sectors get diverse, within inference there will be entire sub sectors between ZK, OP, TEE and Cryptoeconomic security designs depending on the speed/security you need your inference request. 

Maybe you'll also be using a network of DeFi models by @PondGNN or a specific one by @RPS_Labs to power part of your DeFi economy instead of Llama or some random guys fine tuned version. Maybe you'll use @myshell_ai to build the application much more easily and faster or via @0G_labs operating system. 

Unsure which model to use? Maybe you'll go to @sentient_agi or @AlloraLabsHQ or @opentensor to ask a request and be dynamically routed to the highest performant model for a task. These coordination networks are a full meritocracy surfacing the best models for a specific ask. Hence why I'm bullish on billions of specific models, powered by a diverse set of open source foundational models. 

Uniswap will outsource liquidity provision to these networks or models and Aave will outsource its risk engine. Use cases will expand to MEV protection, risk assessment, or protocol optimization. The game-changer will be cross-protocol AI agents that optimize across the entire DeFi stack - imagine an AI that simultaneously manages Uniswap LP positions while adjusting Aave collateral ratios and hedging via perpetual futures, all based on real-time market conditions.

Tired of hacks after manual audits for your app? @testmachine_ai’s prop AI model will audit your contract without 3-6 months and human errors. I simply can't handle more hacks. 

While AI memecoins are cool, I share these projects to show just how early we are and how insane Crypto x AI will become.

My Crypto x AI Flowchart from May, 2024

AI memecoins positively normalized Crypto x AI for the masses, but I think people will get tired of fast forks pretty soon. People will expect use cases and they will take time.

1 -> AI endorses tokens (Terminal of Truth is here)
2 -> AI autonomously trades tokens (Maybe TERMINAL)
3 -> AI creates tokens 
4 -> AI builds and operates protocols 
5 -> AI fully controls and sustains decentralized economies

While it was taboo 6-12 months ago, a full Crypto x AI future where we build and own the models, which power applications that create full ecosystems and economies with no bias or control by a few people in San Francisco is upon us. Strap in.

"Will Ethereum remain institutions' top choice?

@jonahrobrts breaks down the blockchain competition for TradFi's attention 🤼‍♂️

========================================

Disruption. Digitization. Financial inclusion. Future-proofing.

What do all of these oft-repeated buzzwords have in common? They’ve all been used by crypto-pilled associates at TradFi firms to pitch their bosses on the exciting upside of blockchain tech. This year, it seems, the executives are listening.

Institutions jumped into crypto more headlong than ever in 2024. Their moves are starting to bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi. However, this article isn’t focused on why firms are building onchain. Instead, we are focusing on where these funds are choosing to build.

----------------------------

What’s Happening on Ethereum?
Ethereum is the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain network. It has secured over $90 billion in RWAs, including stablecoins. 2024 has been a big year for the adoption of non-stablecoin RWAs on Ethereum as well, with the network growing its onchain U.S. treasuries, bonds, and cash equivalents from $800 million to over $1.5 billion and overall non-stablecoin RWA value to $2.9 billion.

Some of the major players building on Ethereum this year include @Visa, @BlackRock, and @FTI_US

Earlier this month, Visa announced that they are building the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) on Ethereum. This is the company’s biggest step toward crypto adoption thus far. VTAP enables Visa to issue and manage fiat-backed tokens on Ethereum. It is intended to be a sandbox for participating financial institutional partners to create and experiment with fiat-backed tokens. They expect to begin piloting the platform with Spanish multinational bank BBVA in 2025. While the VTAP program is certainly an experiment, it gives credit to the thesis that TradFi will migrate its operations onto Ethereum over the coming decades.

Earlier this year, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton both incepted nine-figure onchain funds. BlackRock’s fund, dubbed $BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), is the larger of the two, currently sitting at $522 million.

BlackRock also leads the institutional charge on crypto ETFs with the launches of its $IBIT Bitcoin and $ETHA Ethereum ETFs. While these funds don’t give investors the chance to custody anything onchain, they do provide a more traditionally attractive method of gaining exposure to the crypto economy. While BlackRock’s head of digital assets, @robbiemitchnick, made clear on Bankless that following IBIT and ETHA, there were no immediate plans to create ETFs for any other crypto assets, the firm has shown interest in integrating elsewhere across the Web3 ecosystem.

----------------------------

Who Else Is Competing for Institutional Attention?
As the landscape expands, Ethereum’s competitors are vying for institutional attention. Solana and Stellar are both making strides, particularly in the realm of RWAs.

-- @StellarOrg's focus on partnerships with large financial institutions like @IBM  has resulted in its second-highest RWA value, boasting $421 million in tokenized RWAs.

-- @solana, often praised for its speed and throughput, is also emerging as an important player in the race toward institutional adoption. Franklin Templeton announced at @SolanaConf that they are bringing compatibility for $FOBXX, their $445 million on-chain fund, to Solana. Still, as things stand, Solana’s RWA value remains relatively low at only $120 million.

EVM-compatible networks such as @arbitrum, @0xPolygon, @avax, and @0xMantle are playing pivotal roles as well. Combining for over $190 million in RWA value, these networks offer institutions familiar smart contract architectures with the added benefit of Layer 2 scalability. Still, Ethereum mainnet’s $2.9 billion in (stablecoin-excluded) RWA value dwarfs these smaller networks, reinforcing its dominance in this space.

Yet, the success of Ethereum’s competitors highlights a critical point: institutions are no longer bound to a single network. While Ethereum is foundational, blockchains like Solana and Stellar provide alternatives that are increasingly hard to ignore. However, they also present novel interoperability concerns.

Interoperability is central to the future of institutional blockchain adoption. As Visa states in their VTAP press release announcement, the largest benefits of building onchain include easy integration, programmability, and interoperability. Institutions that venture onto non-EVM chains like Solana or Stellar may face challenges in asset liquidity and protocol compatibility. This can lead to reliance on third-party services to bridge assets between chains, which introduces complexity and security risks. Ethereum’s widespread use means that staying within the EVM ecosystem—whether through Ethereum or Layer 2 solutions—remains the simplest and most secure option for institutions.

----------------------------

Future Outlook
Institutions like Blackrock are well aware of Ethereum’s value proposition. As BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets noted on Bankless, institutional investors are “students of the market” and “students of the technology.” They rely on proven technologies, and Ethereum’s strong track record makes it the logical choice for most blockchain projects. BlackRock’s collaborations with @coinbase and @circle further highlight how deeply entrenched Ethereum is becoming in the world of institutional finance.

However, for Ethereum to maintain its lead in the race toward institutional adoption, it must continue to balance world-class security and stability with the performance and scalability that competing chains continue to push. The race to capture the attention of institutional finance will be won by the network that can not only meet today’s demands but also anticipate the needs of tomorrow. Ethereum is well-positioned for now, but staying on top will require constant evolution.",0

====================

🟣 Monad

@monad_xyz is an L1 blockchain that has raised $225 million to supercharge the EVM by introducing optimistic parallel execution, targeting a throughput of 10,000 transactions per second.

Parallel execution allows independent transactions to run simultaneously, significantly speeding up processing. Think of it like using multiple washing machines at once: instead of waiting for each one to finish, everything gets done faster while still appearing orderly.

An example of parallel execution and pipelining.

Beyond parallel execution, Monad optimizes performance across the entire stack:

- Enhances performance with its custom consensus mechanism, MonadBFT, which enables single-slot finality for faster transactions.

- Employs deferred execution to separate processing from consensus, improving efficiency and block times.

- Its parallelized custom database, MonadDB, allows asynchronous state access, speeding up data handling.

Notably, Monad's architecture is optimized for consumer-grade hardware, making decentralization more accessible without requiring costly setups for validators.

----------------------

🟢 MegaETH

MegaETH is an Ethereum L2 that pushes Ethereum’s security to new performance levels. Its aim is bold: to build the first real-time blockchain capable of handling 100,000 transactions per second while relying on Ethereum and EigenDA for security and data availability.

The key to MegaETH’s throughput is specialization. Most blockchains make every node do the same tasks — verifying, reaching consensus, and executing transactions. MegaETH changes that by dividing roles.

There are three types of nodes: sequencers, provers, and full nodes. Sequencers handle transaction ordering and execution. Full nodes simply receive state updates to keep their local copies of the chain current. Provers work in the background, validating everything with cryptographic proofs.

Major components of MegaETH and their interaction.

@megaeth_labs also boosts the EVM with in-memory computation, where the sequencer holds the entire EVM world state in memory. This speeds up state access by 1,000 times compared to traditional systems. Moreover, improvements in block-building algorithms and other updates allow MegaETH to tackle issues like latency and throughput.

----------------------

🐻 Berachain

@berachain is a high-performance, EVM-identical L1 blockchain, meaning its execution layer mirrors the EVM runtime environment of the Ethereum Mainnet. This results in a system that supports all the familiar tools and operations developers already know, but with added advantages.

At the heart of these advantages is BeaconKit, a modular, EVM-focused consensus client framework on which Berachain is built. The main benefit of BeaconKit is its ability to integrate the features of the CometBFT consensus algorithm with the EVM execution environment. This effectively modularizes the stack, separating consensus and execution layers to enhance the overall Berachain experience.

BeaconKit can also pair with any EVM execution client, allowing every upgrade to the EVM — like Dencun — to be applied to Berachain automatically. This means Berachain not only retains its EVM-identical status but also speeds it up, scales it, and adds composability without losing compatibility. For example, thanks to BeaconKit, Berachain can achieve single-slot finality, meaning blocks are finalized instantly instead of waiting the usual 12-15 minutes on Ethereum — and much more.

----------------------

🔴 Sei

@SeiNetwork combines the EVM environment with parallel execution, enabling faster and cheaper transactions while leveraging existing tools and the developer community. Its parallel execution allows multiple transactions simultaneously, significantly boosting throughput, and is complemented by SeiDB for rapid state updates.

What's new about Sei is its ""Twin Turbo"" consensus mechanism, which accelerates block times to just 400 milliseconds. It achieves this through two key techniques that eliminate common inefficiencies in consensus protocols:

Intelligent Block Propagation — speeds up block creation, reduces waiting times for validators, and ultimately reduces latency.
Optimistic Block Processing — accelerates finality as validators start processing transactions as soon as they receive a block proposal.
Additionally, Sei incorporates features like interoperability between EVM and CosmWasm, opening the door to the Cosmos ecosystem.

However, Sei does trade off some decentralization among its nodes, as these features introduce quadratic communication complexity. This means that as more validators join, the number of messages grows significantly, making it harder to scale the network.

----------------------

🤔 Closing Thoughts
These ambitious projects aim to scale throughput to thousands of transactions per second, building on Ethereum's achievements. Most are still in early stages; three of the four have yet to launch on mainnet. Only time will reveal their success in scaling, driving adoption, and enabling efficient application development.

What does this mean for Ethereum?

One silver lining is that some of these high-performance chains are L2s, aligning with Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap for scaling. Another positive aspect is that they are all EMV-compatible, building on existing tooling while enhancing it in unique ways, thus advancing EVM adoption.

This is also a critical moment for the Ethereum community, as many are questioning why efforts aren’t more focused on scaling Ethereum itself as an L1. Vitalik appears to be in ""wartime mode"", churning out blog post after blog post about the potential futures for Ethereum. The gist is that Ethereum has several paths to scaling the Ethereum L1’s throughput and importantly, all the avenues are being discussed and explored.

"The Real Reason Prediction Markets Win
(a mini-essay)

so why is trump so far ahead on polymarket?

i think this answer is *really* important to understand the state of crypto social:

it's because people don't play prediction markets rationally

nor do they want to.

rationally, a prediction market is a losing bet unless you have insider knowledge. you're gambling with no more knowledge than polls and public stats. and of course, the house (the prediction market) is taking a cut. so your EV is negative.

rational actors looking to maximize returns are not going to play in prediction markets. it's pure gambling with limited returns over time. there are 1000x other things they can do to make money with a better risk/return profile in crypto.

if you think, like most people, that kamala and trump have a roughly 50/50 chance of winning, it might rationally make sense to go long on kamala when she's underpriced. but you won't make a fortune, you're guessing, and you're still giving a cut to the house.

if you don't agree with that, then let me ask you: would *you* want to go wager millions on kamala *or* trump on polymarket right now? 

if i sound bearish on prediction markets, i'm not. at all.

what @Polymarket is showing us right now is something *genuinely* valuable about prediction markets.

they're a social game.

anyone who's seen anyone betting on horses knows this. you bet on your horse at the ring not because it's a rational economic decision, but because it 100xes your adrenaline to put some real stakes on the outcome.

the reason people bet on prediction markets is because of the *fun of betting on their team.* prediction markets are simply a social game to make tribalism more fun.

once you understand this, you can immediately understand why trump is way ahead on polymarket. gambling degens are likely overrepresented among trump supporters than kamala supporters and more likely to participate in a prediction market in the first place.

there is no real emotional fun in betting big on kamala, a candidate that inspires little passion. but there is *tremendous* emotional fun in betting big on trump, a transgressive pick for highest election official in the world.

what the prediction market is showing us right now, i think, is who people are most *passionate* about. 

and this is crucial to understand the direction of where crypto is going. we can fight speculation all we want while airdrop farmers and MEV farmers continue their pas de deux across liquidity pools in generating the only real financial value this ecosystem knows.

but 15 years later, speculation remains crypto's great use case. the question is how to make it *fun* enough that it's worth it to people who might lose their money because they made friends and relationships and pumped their adrenaline for a few brief hours on a giant rock whirling around the sun.

and the answer to that is tribalism. if you want to know why polymarket and @pumpdotfun  for all their differences, are the two major apps today, this is why. @Polymarket is the crypto-abstracted tool for normies while @pumpdotfun  is the crypto-native tool for degens, but ultimately they do the same thing: they merge speculation with tribalism, gambling with social consensus, those dueling yin-yang antipodes of crypto values, for people to *bet on their team.* 

you might hate this thesis, you might fight it, you might claim casino culture is destroying us all, and i'll nod approvingly of your higher values. but ultimately we need to give polymarket and pump some credit. they've lasted because they're fun to follow. their financial EV isn't great. but their social EV is.

the only question, then, is what happens when sports season and election season ends. what else can humans be tribal about?

and once you understand that crypto *really* only wins by expanding the surface area of tribalism, you'll start to understand why i'm spending my time building what i'm building. 

crypto isn't actually a great tool for people to make money, as anyone in crypto knows. the question that haunts us now is simply the one that's haunted every tech revolution at its nadir:

how do we make crypto a great tool for people to actually have fun?",0
"Ethereum is trying to sit in the goldilocks zone of being maximally decentralized at layer 1 while being expressive enough to allow for things like scaling at layer 2.

To be sure, this is a very difficult task and why Ethereum tends to find itself in a place where most people struggle to understand it and why they should value/care about it.

Regardless of that though, I think that Ethereum is definitely succeeding at finding this goldilocks zone so far:

- 100's of people working on layer 1 and being sustainably compensated for it by the community (@ProtocolGuild)
- 10+ clients powering layer 1 (yay true client diversity!)
- 10,000+ full nodes across the globe
- The most solo/home stakers of any chain *by far*
- Flourishing ecosystem of layer 2's where users get cheap fees and fast txs
- Blobs working perfectly to scale L2's

Oh and of course Ethereum has not given up on scaling the base layer, it just wants to do it while preserving decentralization (aka not brute-forcing it by throwing hardware at it).

I understand that people want Ethereum layer 1 to ""move faster"", but that directly goes against many of the core beliefs and values of Ethereum. In saying that, we can still put more emphasis on potential scaling paths on layer 1 and work more diligently to deliver them (especially those that enhance layer 2's).

Let's scale *all* of Ethereum while keeping it great :)",0

"Optimism's Superchain and Polygon's AggLayer must now welcome a new contender in the race for ultimate composability.

Here's my explainer on @nodekitorg's Javelin, supported by @a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator↓

Composability across blockchains has long been a demand from both developers and users.

With Javelin, @nodekitorg tackles this issue head-on.

Javelin powers Nodekit’s network of integrated chains, aptly named The Composable Network, disrupting traditional shared sequencing layers, including the Optimism Superchain.

Javelin is positioned as a Superbuilder: an emerging narrative that facilitates seamless interoperability and communication between chains. This new type of block builder can construct blocks for multiple chains simultaneously, promoting a more unified ecosystem.

Here's how Javelin addresses key fragmentation issues:

• Users & Liquidity: Javelin consolidates users and transactions by integrating Layer 2s into The Composable Network, providing a more seamless experience.

• User Experience: Transactions can now occur across chains within a single block, removing the need for cross-chain bridges.

• Developer Experience: Integrated L2s within The Composable Network benefit from cross-chain transaction fees and gain flexibility in customizing their stack, from data availability to execution environments.

At its core, Javelin provides a framework for synchronous communication between integrated L2s, allowing chains to operate in harmony without the inefficiencies caused by fragmentation. It also enables the atomic execution of transactions across multiple chains, ensuring that all related transactions are finalized together and guaranteeing transaction finality.

Javelin's primary competitors are the Optimism Superchain and Polygon Agglayer. However, Javelin distinguishes itself by offering greater flexibility and interoperability:

- Optimism Superchain: Chains must build on the OP Stack, providing fast communication within the ecosystem.

- Polygon Agglayer: Offers some flexibility in its stack but experiences slower communication between non-composable chains.

- Nodekit’s Javelin: Allows chains to maintain sovereignty and flexibility while enabling fast, seamless cross-chain communication within The Composable Network.

In December 2023, @nodekitorg secured $1.2 million in a pre-seed round led by @borderless_cap, with participation from prominent players like Avalanche Blizzard, @PolygonVentures, and @wormhole. This was followed by a February 2024 round led by @a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator (CSX).

The future of Web3 composability is bright, and it's intriguing to see what role @nodekitorg will play in shaping it.",0

"Superbuilder' could be the next interesting concept in Web3.

They are building a Web3 where all the L2s work together like a single L1.

A short report on the first Superbuilder 📗, the ultimate solution for cross-chain composability, by @nodekitorg:

1️⃣ Current Problem in L2s: User Interoperability

L2 is the market's current solution for scaling Ethereum.

We get to have faster transactions with higher throughput and lower transaction fees.

But it comes with liquidity fragmentation and broken user experience when bridging to the new L2s.

---

2️⃣ Solution: The Composable Network

To solve the composability issue across chains, @nodekitorg aims to build The Composable Network through Javelin, the world’s first Superbuilder.

To explain in ELI5 version:

Ø Javelin is a connector between current L2s and The Composable Network.

Ø Any L1s and L2s can integrate with Javelin, allowing them to join The Composable Network.

Ø Within the Network, chains communicate with each other quickly – while also maintaining sovereignty and flexibility over their stack.

---

3️⃣ Potential Outcome

Users can effortlessly transact across chains integrated with Javelin within a single block.

This resolves concerns about transaction finality on each chain, as associated transactions are guaranteed and confirmed simultaneously.

Furthermore, Javelin has the potential to collaborate in the areas of intents, chain abstraction, and cross-chain dApps, where demand is rising.

However, since locking mechanisms differ across projects, there’s no single standard. That’s where @Tokenomist_ai steps in, our goal is to standardize and maintain these metrics, ensuring apples-to-apples comparisons across tokens

💰 Circulating Supply: These are tokens actively available in the market, contributing to liquidity

But not every project calculates it the same way, some exclude treasury or foundation holdings, even if unlocked or transferred, while others may omit staked tokens. This inconsistency can make it tricky to get a clear picture of a token’s supply dynamics

"Cardinal sins of crypto VCs:

1. The multiple first-meetings:
You meet with a partner or associate. The meeting goes well. They book another call with one of the other partners. The next call the partner has no idea who you are, wasn’t briefed, hasn’t read the notes, so you have another first meeting.
Bonus points if this happens three or more times.

2. The rug pull
A partner reaches out, heard you were raising, asks for a meeting. At the meeting the partner doesn’t show, sends associate instead.
Bonus if this happens across multiple raises.

3. The anon
You get an intro to a VC, they seem excited. Book a meeting. On the video call the VC is anon, with a f*cking Wassie pfp.
Love having anon money on the cap table, I hear those investors are least crazy and most helpful.

4. The ghosting
You meet with the VC multiple times, they ask a bunch of follow up questions. Ask for more data, financials, roadmap. Then suddenly nothing. Spoooooky.

4. The option 
You spend two weeks on meetings with a fund, answering questions and diligencing. Then you hear nothing for a while and you think you’ve got yourself a ghosting. 
Suddenly you get a “how’s the round coming along? Let’s jump on another call.”  After the call, nothing again. 
Repeat a few more times.
Ghosting? Nope, just farming a free option.
 
5. The bragging 
Thirty minute call with a partner. Spends 25 minutes talking about himself.

6. The farming 
Fund takes a meeting. Digs deep into the strategy, tech stack, analytics. Ghosts. 
A week later announces a round into a competitor.
You’ve been farmed!

7. The derangement 
Thirty seconds into the meeting you’re pretty sure the VC is on stimulants. Things go downhill as they get increasingly belligerent and argue with everything you say.
Wraps up with “let me know how I can be helpful”

8. The side quest
The partner doesn’t understand anything about what you’re building. Spends the entire meeting convincing you to build a completely different business.
Bonus points if they actually convince you.

9. The sage
You hop on a call with a 22 year old associate. His experience consists of a 3 month internship at Goldman and losing his bonus gambling on meme coins. He spends the meeting pontificating and giving you advice.

"The next phase of the Ethereum will be dominated by powerful economic zones.  

You can see them rising.  

Base, Unichain, Zora = Superchain  

zkSync, Cronos, Lens = Elastichain  

Polygon, Immutable, Ronin = Agglayer

Taiko, Puffer, Spire = Based Ethereum

These economic zones will have seamless integration and unified liquidity - they'll feel borderless.  Each zone will compete and also trade with the others, each specialized in areas where they have a comparative advantage.  

Some rollups will remain independent but many will join an economic zone for the growth and liquidity benefits.  

This combinatorial soup of apps vs apps within chains vs chains within zones vs zones competing and cooperating all within Ethereum will create a fractaled primordial soup of creative destruction that would leave Schumpeter in awe.  

ETH will be the only credibly neutral and trustless store of value across it all.

ETH is money.  

This next phase of Ethereum is not even the final form. 

Eventually, these economic zones will unify into a federated but shared pool of global liquidity, security, and integration across a unified Ethereum which preserves the best elements of cooperation and competition.  

Open source permissionless and decentralized economies are unstoppable. Ethereum will grow like the internet.  

None of the above depends on ""projects doing the right thing"" it is simply the result of selection pressures forcing competition and cooperation.  

Ethereum is a substrate for internet economies.

"Hot take: Memecoins are at a MAJOR crossroads. 

Either they cross the chasm into mainstream retail appeal now, or face an imminent local top.

Allow me to explain.

Recently, memes have absolutely exploded. Specifically the ones that @MustStopMurad has highlighted.

If you scroll on 𝕏 right now, your entire feed will be inundated with memecoin bull posts and endless shills. 

It feels, to me, that the majority (maybe not all, but most) of CT has been fully exposed to the meme thesis - and at this point, has either made a decision to join in, or stay away.

At first, meme mindshare was purely limited to 𝕏, and hadn't translated to YT. 

However, over the last few days - I've noticed meme videos starting to perform much better (and going viral), which signals to me that positioning is shifting from pure CT to a more retail audience. Note: This positioning can take days/weeks to occur as the YT audience typically lags. 

This is a bullish thing, right? 

Well yes, maybe in the immediate short term.

However, as the narrative gets more saturated on CT (and YT) - I must ask the question: Is this becoming a crowded trade (for now)?

What you're really looking for at this point, is a proper push into mainstream retail. TikTok, Reddit, Shorts, and eventually mainstream media.

But this is why I say memes are at a crossroads. 

Because I feel as if THIS is the inflection point where either memes cross the chasm into mainstream appeal - or this is a local top.

Why is a ""local top"" on the table right now? 

Well, as I pointed out earlier, pretty much all of CT is shilling the meme narrative. Mindshare is at an ATH, yet the CT pool alone isn't enough to sustain the crazy price increases we've been seeing. And as market caps increase, it takes more capital to sustain momentum.

So either memes cross into the retail chasm now, or, we may put in a local top for a little while and let things temporarily cool down. 

My personal belief is that the latter will be the case (I may be wrong, but this is just my gut feel). 

Longer term (2025), I think memes are truly primed for mass expansion - but I'm not sure retail is ready just yet. A new $BTC ATH, and better performance across alts in general will make conditions even more primed for a proper meme rally. 

I'm longer-term bullish, but wary of piling into what I view to be a crowding trade in the short term.

p.s. I'm mostly referencing the mid-large caps here, as the rotation game into smaller caps probably lasts some weeks after a local top is in. 

p.s. 2. A cooldown in memes would be a great opportunity to accumulate, and isn't a bad thing at all.

p.s. 3. There's always a chance we do 'cross the chasm' now - but it really has to happen in the coming days or that moment may not come until 2025.

Would love to hear your opinions in the comments below.",0

"the answer to this question boils down to two things: secure defi and fully on-chain apps that demand high throughput and fast finality

the movevm enables formal verification and a superior syntax that protects against the billions in hacks we see. the thesis behind secure defi is enabling LPs to feel comfortable deploying large capital into defi vaults and acting on-chain without worrying about security gaps. 

with blockstm + fast finality via postconfs, users now dont have to wait 7 days for finality, pay expensive fees for zk, or be limited to 50 transactions per second.

as for teams, ill start with some of the ones that most people know:

@BRKTgg - tinder for predictions. fully-on chain with micro markets that demand high-throughput execution to scale. doing this on eth would be slow, clunky, and expensive

@upnetworkhq - mobile depin network. thousands of UP phones in production today using movement apps and also serving as nodes. doing this on ethereum itself would be pretty problematic as the UpOS needs high throughput environments to coordinate all their users (imagine if apple or samsung were limited to 5 tps)

@henrysocialxyz - earn rewards everytime you shop, spend, and use. honey processes millions of transactions in web2 with an extensive userbase. doing any kind of rewards app at scale demands finality of transactions (cant wait 7 days for ur amazon order to confirm)

@meridian_money @EchelonMarket @satayfinance - secure DeFi. LPs are sick of being hacked for $4.5B every year - movement aims to be the secure defi hub on ethereum especially as we've seen a large scale MoveVM institutional push

@Lyncworld - thousands of minigames running at once. think Miniclip for crypto.

in the next batch of the collective:

@Rena_labs TEE data marketplace on Movement for  verifiable data for on-chain actions for traders to prevent frontrunning and receive orderbook data 

@getaxal cross-chain text-based agents for high-throughput defi. ""swap from Nexio to Movement to Lumio"" 

@RNDM_IO capital efficient AI for defi. AI agents to manage positions so you dont have to.

GCaller - decentralized caller ID and spam protection platform

@sentimint_life - crypto jewelry and clothing. thousands of memories minted onchain and secured (think hallmark for crypto)

@VanillaFinance - high-throughput and high leverage perps. 10,000x leverage and no liquidation.

@teta_official - remote digital haptic interfaces. robotics meets crypto to provide a ""touch marketplace"" for users

".@uniswap tapped @Optimism's Superchain for their next big endeavor

Everything you need to know about the Unichain 🦄👇

=====================

🦄 What is Unichain?
Uniswap is Ethereum’s cornerstone DeFi application, and Unichain is the latest evolution of this essential token-swapping protocol; its developers aim to replicate the seamless user experience of monolithic blockchains and create crypto’s de facto liquidity hub.

Just like Optimism and @Base, Unichain will be a permissionless general-purpose EVM-compatible rollup with a Uniswap deployment constructed on the OP Stack.

While the Unichain testnet released today is minimally viable proof of concept, come mainnet sometime later this year, the network intends to utilize a trusted execution environment (TEE) secured by UNI validators, who provide fast pre-confirmations and earn network fees for their services, simultaneously reducing user transaction wait times fourfold from 1 second to 200-250 milliseconds while enabling the long-awaited UNI fee switch!

Although Ethereum’s decentralization-first design philosophy is certainly laudable, offloading execution to L2s has undeniably complicated the user experience by fragmenting assets and protocol across isolated blockchains. For Ethereum to achieve mass adoption, it will have to solve for the fragmentation produced by its rollup-centric roadmap with L2 interoperability.

The effort to revolutionize L2 interoperability extends well beyond the construction of Unichain and necessitates the adoption of novel Ethereum-wide interoperability standards, like unified cross-chain trading execution EIPs and interface improvements with respect to how wallets switch chains and display assets balances.

Swaps facilitated by Unichain that originate from alternative networks will still require time-consuming bridging transactions, but proposed OP Stack native interoperability promises to reduce intra-OP Stack bridging wait times and transaction costs.

💪 Superchain Superiority
Due to Unichain’s adherence to the OP Stack standard, any “Superchain” rollup constructed on this framework can easily implement the aforementioned technical improvements, positively benefiting the broader OP ecosystem by reducing transition wait times and enabling functional native token staking capabilities.

Interoperability is easiest between rollups with shared standards, and although Ethereum’s litany of competing rollup frameworks has resulted in technical heterogeneity across the contemporary rollup complex, potential synergies produced by developing on the most popular stack promote inherent winner-take-all dynamics.

Once advanced rollup functionalities like shared sequencing and native interoperability become available, the benefits of constructing within a unified stack should become evident, meaning that Uniswap’s decision to build on the OP Stack must be taken into consideration by any L2 deployers intent on utilizing the self-branded L2 liquidity hub during the rollup stack selection process.

As many OP Stack chains contribute a percentage of sequencer revenues towards ecosystem retroactive public good funding (RPGF) programs, increasing ecosystem activity will translate into greater amounts of capital that can be deployed to create and promote Optimism-aligned standards.

Should Unichain’s ambitions to become crypto’s liquidity hub truly materialize, the experiment will crown Optimism’s OP Stack as the winning rollup framework while definitively proving the soundness of Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap.

💸 The Future of Finance?
In a hypothetical world where Unichain becomes Ethereum’s liquidity hub, free market dynamics would dictate that a majority of onchain swaps are automatically routed through the network, as its deep liquidity would reduce slippage and result in optimal trade execution.

Assuming Unichain can replicate the success of Uniswap’s exchange at the network level, the chain would also become the obvious home for high-performance DeFi applications, where sophisticated participants like institutional market makers derive immense benefits from the shortest possible transaction wait times and best possible execution price.

Still, even with native OP Stack interoperability, it will always be faster and cheaper to transact on a unified crypto network, implying that Unichain must have the deepest liquidity for a given pair and best execution price to be considered as a swapping solution.

Despite the fact that L2s process 22x more transactions than Ethereum, at the time of analysis, a hefty 80% of Uniswap’s TVL remained stored inside of its Ethereum-based smart contracts, and while Uniswap may be free to deploy the Unichain, that does not inherently mean liquidity providers will migrate over.

A Uniswap appchain has long been rumored, and plenty in the Ethereum community have already shared their deep-seated doubts over whether the model can work. Now that Uniswap's audacious vision for Unichain is out in the open, we'll soon get to see who is right.

"Why does DeAI matter? 🤖 ✨

Today, AI development is highly centralized.

Competing in the AI space requires significant resources (capital, compute power, talent), which are monopolized by big tech.

Blockchains offer a decentralized alternative for AI development, enabling broader participation in securing, validating, and optimizing AI models.

@ionet has identified three key areas across which blockchains can help decentralize AI:

➤ Distributed MLOps: Using token incentives and decentralized networks to involve wider talent pools in tasks like data labeling and model finetuning.

➤ Distributed Hardware: Blockchain networks can monetize idle GPUs, offering smaller companies affordable access to essential AI hardware.

➤ Distributed Provenance: Blockchain ensures transparent, verifiable data lifecycles, solving issues like copyright infringement and deepfake threats.

The intersection of AI and blockchain bears great potential to create a more equitable, scalable and secure AI ecosystem with blockchain-based coordination layers reducing centralization in the field, and putting control back into the hands of society as a whole (vs. big tech monopolies).

"A question I’ve been asked a lot lately: Are memecoins here to stay as the dominant mindshare of the market? I've put together some thoughts on the topic and history on how we got here.

To start, I believe the following are the primary factors driving memecoin dominance:

1. Low amount of new innovation in the space despite consistent demand for new tokens (has crypto reached the limits of what it can do without introducing elements of centralization?)
2. Intentional removal of token utility means no limit to calculated valuations
3. Retail desire to put power back in their own hands
4. High user signup conversion on memecoin listings incentivizes exchanges to list many low quality tokens

To understand how long these factors are likely to last, let's dive into each of them with a bit of historical context.

Starting with some history on innovation in the space, we see an interesting progression of technical refinement which to some extent can be simplified to:

2016: Basic smart contract functionality; Eg., The DAO, Etherdelta
2017: Crypto For Everything. Eg., Tokens for dentists, tokens for taxis, etc.
2021: Crypto For Finance + NFTs. Eg., Lending, AMMs, DeFi, collectibles
2023: Infra. Eg., L1s, cheaper / faster txns, etc.
2024: Memes

At first this might all seem uncorrelated, but there’s actually a very clear progression of reduction in scope here. Over these years, the tech starts as a wild west where the possibilities are seen as endless, and with each cycle hones in on more and more specific utility, until it reaches a perceived limit of what can be done purely within the scope of a decentralized network without using non-decentralized elements. After this limit is somewhat reached in the 2021 cycle, we see a significant slowdown in interesting new dApps produced, and the market then begins focusing on improving the infrastructure instead. While infrastructure improvement can continue across many cycles, retail mindshare has a shorter attention span, and with no other innovation to be found it eventually defaults to memes. It's worth noting of course, that memes have always had significant attention; Doge for example, peaked at $80B market cap in 2021. The distinction though is of memes being the foremost trend focus.

This brings us to the second factor behind memecoin mindshare: theoretical valuations. It’s been a long running joke that the most valuable projects should never ship a real product, because then their valuation becomes immediately quantifiable. Except unfortunately, this isn’t even really a joke. DeFi in 2024 is a prime example of this: in an efficient market, investors will take less than 5 minutes to look at a project’s baseline, slap a 20x P/E on it, and decide it shouldn’t be worth a penny more. This is by far the largest reason that DeFi struggles to have a bull market again in the current cycle.

In 2021 we saw some projects cleverly design their tokenomics to be so complicated that few could tell what the real revenue actually was or whether the project was sustainable. This arguably led to some of the best ponzis of the cycle, but ultimately crashed hard enough that market appetite for opaque tokenomics hasn’t returned. So of course, for meme coins the solution is simple- throw utility out the window altogether, and the project is no longer quantifiable. Brilliant! Amusingly, memecoins this cycle that have attempted to add utility have often hurt their valuations by doing so.

The most straight-forward reason for memecoins dominating this cycle is of course the desire of retail investors to bring power back from VCs and institutions to the hands of the little guys. The reality of course, is that it’s only a slight shift in where the bulk of the profits end up going, and unfortunately it’s still not to retail. Instead, it’s a shift from VCs to “sharks” in the space. In essence, lean teams of incredibly efficient participants that understand how to corner the supply of a token, market it as organic, and repeat over and over. There are so many examples of this that I’m not even going to call out specific names.

A key component that makes this playbook so viable is that the market has unfortunately decided that market cap is a signal of legitimacy, which incentivizes cornering the supply of tokens to artificially prop valuations. Of course, the market goes back and forth in fighting this battle; solutions like Pump Fun were created to mitigate the ability to opaquely corner supply, which has led in turn to more sophisticated sniping and accumulation techniques being created, and the battle carries on. But ultimately, memecoins do end up putting a vast majority of profits in the hands of organized groups, while teasing the rare organic lottery wins to the average retail to keep the game appealing.

And finally, a discussion on exchange listings. I’m surprised I don’t see this talked about more, but exchanges are massively propelling the current memecoin craze due to the incentive structure they have in listing. In particular, listing teams want to list coins that will drive maximum user onboarding- ie., how many users will sign up and make their first deposit to the exchange as a result of a particular listing. Coins with wide distribution in new ecosystems do particularly well with this; for example, clicker games on TON were quoted to be bringing in several million new users per listing (a shockingly high number) in an in interview with Bybit’s CEO:

Popular memecoins tend to get wide distribution in small quantities since they’re easy to understand by casual retail; this results in high user signup /deposit conversion. But the incentives here are misaligned. For the listing teams it looks good- the numbers are high and it hits their OKR for a satisfactory performance review. But the reality is that many of these are low quality signups, and it often incentivizes listing low quality tokens to hit these numbers. Ultimately, it is very likely leading to a longterm degradation of listing quality and innovation in the space. I have some other thoughts on listing processes in general, but I’ll leave that for another post.

So with a better understanding of what brought us to this point, do I think the memecoin mindshare lasts? For at least the medium term, yes.

For memes to lose mindshare, we need to see an innovative new narrative that is truly crypto native (ie., not a centralized hybrid tech) with decent ponzinomics. And the unfortunate reality is that this is much harder to achieve now than it used to be. AI is the closest thing to this right now, but in most cases runs into the question of “why do we even need crypto for this?”. As mentioned in a previous post, I see there being a couple interesting bluechip exceptions to this. There are also a few DeFi projects in the pipeline that I consider to be interesting + innovative, and I have hopes could be the beginnings of a newer narrative down the line.

"Heuristic of making money on memes:

Memes act  closely to a monetary asset - increase in liquidity and agreement on social consensus leading to buy in hope of much higher- leading to higher market caps

The game unlike money though is that - one does not want to save in memes - they want to buy only in order to sell

So how the game is played is very large price predictions that are above reasonable- buying low as possible and then Kols selling for 50-100x - 10-20% of the way to their public target in order to entice the last person in that it can still go higher

Listen to what Murad/Ansem actually says and does and where all the real money has been made in memes - it has not been made buying billion dollar plus memes - its made buying sub 100m MC and them moving to the billions where the price target is tens of billions

Across a portfolio you wont make money in aggregate buying 3-5bn MC memes because winners wont cover for losers and % gains arent big enough to make a difference when you factor execution - might aswell just own bitcoin and not worry about it as when you factor execution alts in general need to do 3x more in btc to get same result in the end

All the winners you can name in Crypto who made a killing didnt go all in on memes - they put a small % in but the meme went from 10m to 500m-1bn etc and now its majority of their port but it didnt start that way - thats where the money is made

Hence if you cant make a killing with 10-20% of port on memes you wont be able to make a killing with 100% of port

Thats also why Doge and Shiba have not risen so far in this meme run - people are looking to make money not adopt memes

The end of memes this cycle is *probably* more like 10-20 memes going to multi billions and then fading while most are left holding the bag thinking its going much higher then the narrative of memes from this cycle going to 50-100bn as stated by Kols

So if you want to play memes - you put a small % separate to investment port into some low caps that you are ready to lose all on and then its ride or die mentality - thats the way to go

The biggest win so far for Murad is SPX which he bought at 10mc not 500m - Ask yourself if Kols all really really believed memes going to 100bn then why are they personally only looking at sub 200mc memes - its because the R/R and payoff doesnt make sense otherwise in aggregate and the people shilling at 2-3bn MC are the ones that already bought much lower

Traders are different as they just need movements in volatility to make money so they will play every MC but thats a different story",1

"Based Rollups

What are they, why do they exist, and which projects are already making waves?

A 101 explainer 👇                                                                                                                                      

==================================

Scaling #Ethereum has been one of the most discussed challenges in crypto.

To address this, the community chose a rollup-centric approach. The idea is simple: Instead of hosting all applications on Ethereum, the focus is on rollups that offer faster, cheaper transactions while still settling back on Ethereum. As a result, you get faster, cheaper transactions, but still keep Ethereum’s security.

We now have optimistic rollups like @Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, and @Base alongside zk-rollups like @ZKsync, all contributing to Ethereum's growth.

They're bringing more users and value to Ethereum, however, concerns remain about their reliance on centralized sequencers and liquidity fragmentation across chains.

This is where based rollups come in. They integrate more closely with Ethereum's infrastructure, helping retain value within the ecosystem. This new method of building rollups could bring additional value to Ethereum and $ETH.

What are Based rollups?
Based rollups, or L1-sequenced rollups, are a type of rollup where the base L1 chain, like Ethereum, manages transaction sequencing directly.

Unlike traditional rollups that rely on their own sequencers, based rollups tap into the security, liveness, and decentralization of the L1 by outsourcing transaction sequencing to the L1’s infrastructure. This infrastructure includes proposers, searchers, builders, and other actors who permissionlessly include based rollup blocks in L1 blocks.

Initially, this approach seemed inefficient — @VitalikButerin once called it ""total anarchy"" in his 2021 article on rollups. But today based rollups have become much more feasible. In 2023, Ethereum researcher @drakefjustin brought the concept back into focus, arguing that based rollups not only align more closely with Ethereum but also eliminate the need for separate security assumptions for each new rollup.

How do Based rollups work?
Based rollups use the L1 for consensus, data availability, and settlement layers, while handling execution independently. For instance, when Ethereum is the base L1, the key layers of based rollups are as follows:

1. Execution Layer — Managed by the rollup itself, where transactions are executed off-chain.

2. Consensus Layer — Relies on Ethereum validators to sequence transactions.

3. Data Availability Layer — Uses Ethereum as the DA layer to ensure that transaction data is available for validation by anyone.

4. Settlement Layer — Also part of Ethereum, where final transaction states of the rollup are recorded.

Based rollups use Ethereum for everything from ordering transactions to settling them. While this approach may not seem radically different from traditional rollups, it fundamentally shifts how sequencing is handled. Instead of relying solely on separate sequencers, based rollups leverage Ethereum itself for transaction sequencing.

In a traditional rollup, users send their transactions to a dedicated sequencer — essentially a single machine operated by the rollup team. This sequencer is responsible for collecting user transactions, determining their sequence, and packaging them into blocks that are posted on Ethereum.

In contrast, based rollups direct user transactions to block builders who manage both Ethereum and the rollup. This use of Ethereum’s infrastructure allows based rollups to benefit from the same guarantees provided by Ethereum, enabling transactions to achieve finality more reliably than in non-based rollups.

Top projects in the based rollup landscape
As a relatively new concept, based rollups are still being developed, with a few key projects emerging:

@taikoxyz — an Ethereum-equivalent (Type 1) ZK-EVM that is maximally compatible with Ethereum and does not introduce additional trust assumptions.

KeySpace — a zk-rollup by @Coinbase aimed at creating smart wallets usable across any chain.

@gwyneth_taiko — a based rollup using pre-confirmations, designed for synchronous composability with Ethereum.

@puffer_unifi — a based rollup developed by the @puffer_finance team that employs pre-confirmations to enhance user experience.

@Spire_Labs — a framework on Ethereum that allows developers to build based appchains.

Why based rollups?
As Justin Drake outlined in his original post, based rollups are worth your attention for several reasons:

1. Inherited Liveness and Decentralization — One of the key advantages of based rollups is their ability to inherit the liveness guarantees of the base L1 chain. As long as the L1 is operational, so is the rollup.

2. Economic Alignment with L1 — The economic model of based rollups creates a mutually beneficial relationship with the L1. Priority fees and MEV from these rollups naturally flows to the L1. This synergy doesn’t just add value to the base layer, it also boosts the legitimacy and brand awareness of the rollups themselves, thanks to Ethereum’s community.

3. Cost Efficiency — Outsourcing sequencing to Ethereum reduces development costs, accelerates time to market, and lowers user costs (especially at scale) for based rollups.

However, based rollups have trade-offs. They sacrifice some profitability by relying on Ethereum for sequencing, missing out on priority fees and MEV. Additionally, they contend with Ethereum's inherent challenges, such as slow block times, which can cause latency issues.

These challenges explain why existing rollups are designed with their own sequencers — to offer a fast user experience. Although solutions like pre-confirmations of inclusion and execution are being discussed as potential ways to enhance the user experience of based rollups, it remains uncertain whether such improvements can be achieved without introducing trusted third parties.

There's a real debate that these changes might compromise the simplicity and security that initially made based rollups appealing.

"Hoeflation is the obfuscation of messages on a global stage, hiding away the vital truth of what it constitutes to be human through a fiat currency system and the construction of the idea of housing (a government can and always will be able to take it away from you), of rights, of values, essentially, an open conspiracy where you are Wilson in the chair, locked with wrists shackled against the cold steel while your face is forced to smile against the rats of modernity, screeching, hissing into your eyes, ears and nostrils with the putrid absurdity of it all pushed down your soul till nothing remains but a whisper of what once was, that will never return. 

It is the driving force of inflation and the derivation of value into speculative markets that leads to the gradual collapse of modern society. Technology, AI, all these beautiful new inventions of the 21st century are simply deflationary tools to cover up the collapse, cover up the hysteria brewing, and disguise it all with a veneer of silicon lips and BBL injections as an egirl tells you, “have you registered to vote yet? Your vote COUNTS. YOU count!” 

Yet, most people do not matter. Most people do not count. Such is the efficacy of the bell curve, of odds, of the roll of dice in the lottery of life, where one may be born a cretin or an aristocrat, a pauper or a prince, a royal or a ragamuffin cast to the street. 

Live with a smile, laugh with a grin, while reality scrapes you into the ground with every day passing by, the sun rising and falling, the smog of the city, the chemtrails of the countryside, the electromagnetic screams of the archons reverberating throughout your organism as you wade through the wagedom and serfdom of society. No less, this has been the state of humanity since we fell from the Garden, and found ourselves trading blood, love and youth for the feeble fruit of the ground, or the spilt blood of an animal as it is left to bleed dry before being skinned and gutted for a meal. Souls sacrificed on a conveyor belt of steel and pixelated screens, tax numbers for the long arm of legislation to terrorize and collect their penance due each annum. 

The loss of fertility in modern society is not due to the cost of living, the lack of housing, or even, the lack of familial or cultural support. It is due to a loss of meaning across the board for humanity, the distortion of desire from a silver screen once written before, the sailors fighting in the dancehall, the freakiest show of a clown world, the best selling show where one screams, is there life on Mars? One prays there might be remnants of a past great archaic human civilisation there, remaining in cryogenic suspension with the tools to return to Earth to finish what the better demons of our World Wars could not. 

There is no desire to keep life going, when life is not worth living. There is no desire to preserve culture, when intuitively one knows the culture being preserved has been bastardized, twisted, melded into an Esperanto of farces and illusions, the men chasing the great desire of more, more, MORE, the women placating themselves on cheap dopamine, the children left in an acid vault of brain rot, cottagecore skibidi alpha rizz ohio the Orgy Porgy chant of the 21st century, the carrion call to forget the past, to forget the wisdom written in blood of past wars, to ignore the warning stones of tsunamis and to plant flags upon quicksand and bottomless swamps, crying out, “This is mine! You can’t take it, I OWN it.” 

What is owned on the Earth when in a millennia, few will remember your name? The man that first blew air into a reed to entertain children at candlelight perhaps was the genius that sparked the flame of music, but what was his name? What were the features of his face, the smile he had as a tune emerged from the rudimentary instrument he fashioned likely from the forest surrounding?

"Jotting down a few notes about what I liked about each team at Monad Madness, in the order of presentations.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like an intro to any of these teams.

PART 1

@TowneSquarexyz is enabling Dapp Abstraction to meaningfully accelerate the onboarding process for all apps in the Monad ecosystem. Their side-by-side video showing onboarding with and without Townesquare was night and day. In addition to the laser-sharp vision, I liked the team's thoughtfulness and hustle.

@LEVR_bet is bring leveraged sports betting to life. Leveraged sports betting means that users can bet up to 5x leverage; the leverage comes from the fact that odds are monitored in realtime and positions are liquidated if the odds decline too much. Real-time risk management (and the very real-time possibility of liquidation) makes the whole proposition that much more rewarding and engrossing.

@chippedsocial created NFC-chipped press-on nails.  They are building in a massive market (1B/year) and have already captured significant mindshare (3M impressions) while building a product that is unabashedly for women in a space that rarely considers selling to women. I like that there are so many possibilities for further expansion, as the product touches decentralized identity, network creation, and biohacking, while already carving out a niche with high virality and margins.

@Hyperplex_xyz is enabling more capital-efficient and versatile AMMs, where users get better yields as the system identifies opportunities to earn yield from lending assets out to other protocols. Their presentation was crisp and compelling and they nailed the value prop for end users.

@particleink is building an alternate world using AR to create a rich set of interactions and gamified experiences between us and the inhabitants of that world. A variety of gameplay modes and rich visuals immerse the user. I liked that the gameplay is very open and there are a ton of unique angles for user acquisition and feature expansion.

@DrakeExchange is building a 1-click perpetuals DEX with a hybrid order book and AMM model to take on the CEX monopoly. The team implements new features quickly, like order expiries, margin collateral swap, a stablecoin for funding rate arbitrage, to build a feature-rich and slick interface for trading.

@AccountableData is building tools that make bilateral lending and custody safer by enabling proof-of-reserves and accurately tracking collateral and obligations. The team is utilizing the latest tech (currently, TEEs, with plans to add ZKPs) to securely monitor assets on a variety of exchanges and counterparties. I liked that the team hustles hard (36 custom adapters in place already) and has strong founder-market fit, as CEO Wojtek previously launched the credit arm of Maven 11 which issued 1B in loans during the last bull market.

@CadenceProtocol (Symphony) is building a 1-click cross-chain perpetuals aggregator. Users submit an order on one chain, which is split into suborders on different exchanges/chains and executed by solvers. Symphony gives you an AA wallet on every chain so that you have full custody of the position on each chain, while aggregation tools allow you to manage positions individually or in aggregate. I liked the team's thoughtfulness about UX.

@ammalgam is building a Decentralized Lending Exchange (DLEX), which combines an AMM with a lending protocol. In addition to optimizing yield for LPs using lending opportunities, Ammalgam offers exotic payout structures via preset recipes. I liked the team's use of math to construct useful payout primitives.

@Plato2Earn is building a gamified dining experience where eaters, restaurants, and network participants can all collectively win. Eaters get rewards for frequenting local businesses; businesses get user acquisition tools and purchasing data; and Plato diehards can stake on the success of restaurants. I liked the unique angle and the fact that Plato is going after a massive market while being able to play a great ground game focused on individual neighborhoods.

@InfPools is enabling liquidation-free leverage trading, utilizing the familiar model of UniV3-style LPing to allow LPs to sell the right to swap one asset for another at a fixed price. The model allows borrowers to secure a backstop for their levered position in return for paying a funding rate, eliminating the risk of liquidation. I liked the team's clear vision and commitment to heads-down execution over the past two years.

@rethinkablexyz (IntroLink) is helping crypto-natives to 10x their BD by creating a means to request and supply warm introductions. I liked that the team ships very rapidly, building their telegram app in a matter of weeks, and I like the potential for many different angles across BD and recruiting.

Now, what exactly is OIS?
To put it simply, OIS is a revolutionary mechanism designed to enhance Oracle accuracy and security.

It introduces a strong incentive for both data publishers and stakers to prioritize data integrity by directly tying staking rewards to the precision of price feeds.

Why does this matter? 🤔
In DeFi, the accuracy of oracles can make or break a protocol. $PYTH ensures top-notch reliability.

Stakers and data publishers are penalized for inaccurate data and rewarded for accuracy.

OIS creates a self-regulating ecosystem where only the most reliable price feeds survive.

"the solana endgame

computers are just a bunch of electrical machinery (hardware) wired together

software allows you to use that hardware to accomplish useful tasks, like doing math, or sending messages across machines

however, for that software to be friendly to the user, people add abstractions on top of it (i.e., you don't want the user to read machine code or binary 010101, you want a human-understandable language)

but these abstractions add up to hurt the performance of the machine

it's like if you're a native english speaker and you know a little bit of spanish — but you're asked to give a speech in spanish

you can still communicate ideas roughly, but you'd be much more expressive in native english

it's the same idea in performance, software often gets in the way of utilizing the full capability of these machines

the end state of computer performance is software that can take use the full power of the underlying hardware

this is solana's design philosophy

if you can write the software in such a way such that the only final limiting factor is the strength of the hardware (i.e., the internet connection or RAM) — then you're done

because i) hardware gets better over time, meaning the entire system gets better since it's designed with this philosophy in mind and

ii) if the entire capacity of the system is met, people are incentivized to add more hardware to improve the system (because if capacity is met, that means there's demand, and hence you will capture economic activity by being able to meet it)

sounds pretty simple right? well, the problem is that this is insanely difficult to do

random religious zealot armchain engineers on this app will say stupid remarks like ""ah yeah, they just cranked up hardware requirements, that's all"" — but this makes no sense

(you can even confirm this yourself, there are a ton of Windows computers that have beefier specs than Apple's M-chip series, yet Apple is still more performant in most cases)

as another example, you can just take the 100 alt L1s that came before Solana which actually did just beef up hardware specs — how come they're nowhere near as performant? 

because the design philosophy is not ""turn up the hardware"" — the philosophy is: ""write software to take full advantage of the underlying hardware""

this required countless new systems like Solana's SVM, Gulfstream, Turbine, PoH, etc and it's still not done

for example: people will often troll vote transactions on solana, but have no idea why they exist. it's so that the system can scale while adding more nodes to consensus — otherwise you hit a certain point (in tendermint, it's about 100 nodes), where adding more nodes (and more security) to the system starts hurting performance

""just crank up node requirements"" doesn't work — you need ruthless engineering, which is what the Solana community consists of

this is a super ambitious and inspiring vision. being able to design a global world computer that is as performant as physical hardware and physics will allow can enable for composability, scale, and censorship resistance that we've never seen before

it is the very essence of the concept of acceleration",0
"The Crypto AI Bull Thesis

Read this as someone who was extremely skeptical of AI tokens just a few months ago and thought they were merely a hype-driven, frothy narrative.

The more I research and go down the rabbit hole, the more bullish I become.

Even after only a week of deep research, I have the same feeling I did when I first discovered crypto in 2019.

It seems too obvious that the world is heading toward an almost purely autonomous and digital state. Our lives are nearly fully consumed by some form of machine learning, whether we realize it or not.

But we’ve reached a point of conflict in how AI interacts with our everyday lives.

The Pitch

Scraping data across the internet to feed Large Language Models (LLMs) has nearly been fully maximized.

Currently, these LLMs are primarily controlled by a few large private entities due to the massive resources and compute power required to add orders of magnitude to data sets.

The most prized possession in society began with commodities, then gold and precious metals, followed by money, oil, and now attention. But what’s next? Data.

As we live in the attention/information era, everything can be reverse-engineered through data. I’m not saying attention will become obsolete, but it will continue to grow alongside data, both of which will be heavily impacted by AI.

Take Mr. Beast, for example, the world’s largest YouTube channel. He’s going to reach a point where private companies will want access to his YouTube analytics. They might pay $10 million for access to his analytics because they’ll be able to take audience retention data, click-through rates, sentiment analysis, mentions, etc., and reverse-engineer it.

Since public data is almost fully maximized by LLMs already, content creators and professionals, in general, will become more in demand for their authentic data, allowing others to train their models with better accuracy.

As LLMs advance, attention can be rapidly reproduced through data. Moving forward, those with access to the best data and machine learning models will advance far beyond anyone relying on traditional systems.

""Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the Intelligence Age is paved with compute, energy, and human will."" - Sam Altman

Smart Money

The AI market cap is only $30 billion. As NEAR and ICP aren’t exclusively AI tokens the market cap should really only be approx $20 billion in theory.

Recently, a new $30 billion fund by Microsoft and BlackRock was formed to invest in AI infrastructure. This fund alone is the same size as the crypto AI market.

Look at the top stocks in the world (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.). They are all primarily data-focused companies. All of them are heavily investing in and developing AI because their platforms are driven by data. They need access to the best data sets and LLMs to stay ahead and become more efficient in product development.

AI is the only narrative that can compete in terms of ""sexiness"" besides memecoins. The goal is to attract external funding beyond just crypto natives, as we can only take a sector so far (restaking is a good example of this) due to the complex lingo and high barrier to entry. Plus, there isn’t much demand for the economic security being offered.

Investing in AI makes people feel smart and allows them to justify their investments both internally and externally.

“Honey, I was investing in the future of technology.”

“But you lost our house deposit on dog meme coins in 2021, which was supposed to be the future of finance.”

You can probably tell where I’m going with this.

I was talking to a non-crypto friend the other day about what might bring crypto back to the mainstream, aside from ETFs and memes. Naturally, the conversation turned to AI, as people already associate it with products they use in their daily lives.

The pitch is far easier when there's already some form of association, rather than trying to hard-sell a new decentralized wireless network using a novel type of bandwidth.

One counterargument to the crypto AI thesis is that Web2 companies want their data centralized and private, so they wouldn’t venture into crypto. Other sectors, like Real World Assets (RWA), have indirect support from ETF inflows and BlackRock’s tokenization plans.

But this is actually part of the bull thesis. Private companies are running out of data, and crypto offers a decentralized free market for participants to contribute to data sets through financial incentives.

Because of this, the transparency of data is easily traceable and verifiable, which is extremely important in research fields like medicine.

This only touches the surface of data and doesn’t even dive into what the compute layer and algorithms can offer.

The Tech

This has already become a long thread, so I’ll keep this brief, though it could have several posts dedicated to it.

Three pillars of AI:

Data – The foundation of AI, allowing advanced models and algorithms to learn, improve, and make predictions. There are many layers involved in handling data, from how it’s gathered to how it’s processed and fed into models. 

Data transport is expensive due to bandwidth and latency costs, especially when moving large datasets. To lower costs, researchers are exploring methods such as edge computing, where data is processed locally rather than on centralized servers, reducing both financial costs and time delays.

Compute – Refers to the computational resources (hardware) needed to process data and run algorithms. AI requires powerful hardware, like GPUs or TPUs, to train models and run tasks. 

NVIDIA's stock surge reflects the growing demand for GPUs that power the compute layer of AI. The H100, NVIDIA’s data center-grade GPU, has become a standard tool for AI researchers and enterprises.

Algos – Provide the mathematical framework determining how AI models process and learn from data. Algorithms train models using the data processed by the compute layer (GPUs), allowing AI to refine its performance. 

AI agents, autonomous bots, are gaining attention, especially in reinforcement learning, where they adapt in sandbox environments. In crypto AI, these agents could autonomously use crypto to purchase data or tools, optimizing their learning processes.

Use Cases

Identifying the best product-market fit for Crypto AI is still challenging, and we’re likely yet to see the real ""big hitter."" I’m focusing on a couple of areas, one being projects with strong data training incentive models that could become marketplaces for development beyond publicly scraped data. 

Developers or quants, for example, could build careers from creating data sets through internal research and selling them on marketplaces, similar to a freelance service. We’re already seeing this on platforms like @opentensor.

AI agents could use crypto or stablecoins to test and refine trading models or assist in building data sets, unlocking more automated processes beyond the limits of traditional payment methods like credit cards.

Decentralizing AI opens up a marketplace for the world’s most valuable resource—data. Think of how 3rd world countries now have access to stablecoins to offset their declining native currencies, much like how AI could democratize access to critical data resources.

Does AI really need crypto? The answer is yes, as most developers want AI to be open-sourced and not confined to private companies. 

The problem with private companies dominating AI is that it disproportionately maximizes the abilities of the top 0.1%. A knowledgeable developer using an industry-leading model can be 10x more effective than the average person using a subscription-based model to complete basic tasks.

Here’s a random idea as a use case: imagine a robotics company going bankrupt. The founding team might want to retain some cash to fund new ventures, but buyouts are tough. They could upload their knowledge and research data from their robotics work, which could then be bid on in a marketplace to train models in similar fields.

The future of AI is about to become highly personalized. Personalization is key to the next AI breakthrough; stripping out personally identifiable information diminishes the utility of data.

AI is only going to become exponentially better and I don’t think people are pricing in that aspect yet.

Unfortunately this thread is already far too long, and it still feels like I’ve barely scratched the surface. More to come.

"L1/L2 Culture Wars 

As L1/L2 ecosystems mature, the battle to acquire developers, builders, and talent is becoming even more aggressive. What may have worked in the past may not be effective now. It turns out that two ecosystems currently have the strongest foothold in the developer community: EVM and SVM. While EVM evolves over time, it has been predominantly represented by Base, and SVM by Solana.

When founders join Alliance, they usually have a clear idea of which L1s or L2s they want to build on. This choice effectively reflects the current market demand for those chains and how well the L1s/L2s are doing in recruiting high-quality builders. The projects that emerge from Alliance are a reflection of where builders choose to align themselves.

It's very hard to convince builders to develop on new chains unless there is a significant technical advantage that gives them a 10x improvement over competitors on other chains. In such cases, they might accept the platform risk because the potential payout could be 100x. However, this incentive is diminishing over time as established chains like Base, Solana, and others continue to improve throughput, reduce costs, and increase speed—all while acquiring talent and developers at a high rate.

For new chains, it's becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with leading chains in both acquiring mindshare and executing on products that make it easier for builders to develop. Examples include Base's Smart Accounts combined with access to 110 million Coinbase users, or Solana's Integrated first approach, all-time highs in monthly active wallets, and innovations like Firedancer.

I've also noticed stark cultural differences between the Solana and Base communities. The Base community feels more open to everyone, less speculative, more creator-focused, and is about onboarding everyone on-chain. In contrast, Solana seems more focused on attracting engineering-first builders and developing products across a wide spectrum.

We're starting to witness the first signs of a culture war between Solana and Base, where founders are leaving one chain for another because they don't align with the values of their previous chain. I've seen this happen with both Base and Solana. I'm not sure if this is just the beginning or if it will grow bigger, but to me, one of the enduring strengths of chains is the culture they've built over the years.

Not saying this is a winner-takes-all market by any means, but so far, a few chains are winning developer mindshare. As new chains prepare to launch, it will become increasingly harder to compete with the momentum.",0

- More than 6.6M active addresses

As data breaches become increasingly prevalent, one programming language is setting new standards in blockchain security: Move.

A deep dive comparison into Move-based chains 👇👇

1) Origin of Move

Move was born from Facebook’s Diem project (formerly known as Libra) with the goal of addressing limitations in existing blockchain languages like Solidity (Ethereum) and Rust (Solana). The focus was on improved security and a better developer experience.

@MovementLabsXYZ M2 is bringing Move to Ethereum as a Layer 2 solution. Key features include:

• Ethereum Compatibility: Integrating Move with the Ethereum ecosystem.
• Fractal Module: For Solidity-to-Move translation.
• Cross-VM Interoperability: Between Sui Move, Aptos Move, and MEVM.
• Integration with Celestia: For data availability.

2) Limitations of Solidity

In Solidity, the blockchain state revolves around addresses. Assets are typically stored in a mapping within an address’s storage, which can make managing them across different addresses and contracts complicated. This model can introduce security vulnerabilities and complexity in asset management.

3) Move’s Asset-Based Model

Move transforms smart contract development with an asset-based storage model, unlike Solidity’s address-based method. This design provides Move with built-in scarcity and access control. An asset can’t be in two places at once or be duplicated, which enhances security and simplifies development.

4) Program Structure in Move

Move consists of two types of programs:

• Transaction Scripts: Atomic, single-use scripts that execute transactions.
• Modules: Published in the global state, similar to smart contracts in other languages.

Unlike the EVM, Move uses static dispatch instead of dynamic dispatch. This is crucial in preventing certain types of vulnerabilities.

5) Advantages of Static Dispatch

With static dispatch, all function calls are resolved at compile-time. This means the exact code to be executed is known before the transaction is processed, eliminating uncertainties associated with dynamic dispatch. This significantly reduces the risk of re-entrancy attacks and other runtime vulnerabilities.

6) Enhanced Security Features

Move incorporates additional security measures:

1. Move Prover (MVP): A formal verifier providing mathematical proof of a contract’s correctness.
2. Bytecode Verifier: Checks all modules and transaction scripts for safety before execution.

7) Strong Static Typing

Move’s robust static type system catches many errors at compile-time, reducing the risk of runtime errors. Combined with module structs and generics, it offers more robust type safety compared to EVM’s contract types.

8) Move vs. Other Systems

Move offers a more secure and efficient alternative to traditional blockchain programming languages, addressing many of the pitfalls found in Solidity and others. Its asset-based model and strong typing make it a powerful tool for developers focused on security.

9) Aptos vs. Sui: Two Major Move-Based Chains

Let’s dive into a comparative analysis of Aptos and Sui, the two major Move-based chains. Both were developed by former Facebook Diem team members but take different approaches to implementing Move’s asset-oriented design.

>> Fundamental Architecture

• Aptos: Utilizes a more traditional, address-centric design (like Ethereum).
• Sui: Employs a novel object-centric model using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

>> Transaction Processing

• Aptos: Uses Block-STM for parallel execution, processing thousands of transactions per second.
• Sui: Leverages its DAG structure for high throughput and scalability.

>> Consensus Mechanisms

• Aptos: Implements AptosBFT, based on the HotStuff protocol.
• Sui: Utilizes Narwhal and Bullshark for shared objects; Mysticeti for even faster settlement.

>> Smart Contract Capabilities

Both chains leverage Move’s security features:

• Aptos: Introduces “resource accounts” for flexible on-chain governance.
• Sui: Offers native support for upgradeable smart contracts and programmable transaction blocks for efficient, multi-step operations.

>> Fee Models and Unique Features

Aptos:
• Fee Market: Global fee market.
• Unique Feature: Familiarity for developers used to traditional models.

Sui:
• Fee Market: Localized fee markets to prevent network-wide spikes.
• Unique Feature: Radical departure from traditional models with its object-centric approach.

>> Current Adoption

• Sui: Has seen a significant rally recently, with increasing liquidity and volume.
• Aptos: While showing on-chain growth, this hasn’t yet been reflected in its price action.
